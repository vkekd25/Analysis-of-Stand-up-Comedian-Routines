Adam Sandler,September,9,1966,Risqué,27,63.2,2618,1523,"One of the most peculiar apparitions on “Saturday Night Live” was Adam Sandler, a tall geek with short-cropped hair and the woefully sulky face of a perpetually bullied loser.He seemed to enjoy playing “pity me” parts, adopting a babyish, almost retarded voice that seemed stuck so deeply in his gullet it couldn’t be removed with a spoon—and that his classmates had tried.The flip side to Sandler’s character was that, like many a school spaz, when given the chance to shine, he did little more than annoy. Grabbing a guitar, Sandler would offer up inane ditties with what passed for an ingratiating, little-boy smile. The stupider the song, the more the laughs.And so it was that the Jerry Lewis of the 90’s was born…and to the shock of many, Sandler left “Saturday Night Live” to become one of the comic heroes of Generation X. They couldn’t get enough of his class moron character…the brainless insults he hurled, the dorky things he did, the assinine songs he sang.Ironically, the very parents who were chided for enjoying the reckless and destructive antics of Jerry Lewis, were now wondering what in the world their precious Max, Courtney, Brittany and taylor were doing chortling over Adam Sandler. Sandler, a young kid who seemed to have become an overnight success.Actually, he pretty much was. Born in Brooklyn, raised in New Hampshire, Adam tried out at a Boston comedy club when he was just 17. A class clown type, he transferred his act easily to the stage, getting laughs by goofing around. He received his B.F.A. at New York University and journeyed back to Brooklyn where “The Cosby Show” was being taped. There he had the recurring role of young Theo Huxtable’s friend Smitty.Dennis Miller saw him performing stand-up in Los Angeles and reccomended him to Lorne Michaels. Sandler joined “Saturday Night Live” in 1990 as a writer, then as a performer. As with most everyone on the show, Sandler’s job was to create a few characters and then repeat them in bludgeoning fashion until viewers surrendered with laughter.He created “Canteen Boy,” the ultimate in lives-to-be-punched patheticness, and the monsterously grating “Opera Man,” who could only sing his observations ? the very essence of a 6 year-old’s idea of funny. And, like a 6 year-old, Sandler kept doing it over, and over, and over. Many critics singled him out for abuse, but his young fans were supporting him, pushing his 1993 debut comedy album into the Top 100. His next audio assault came with the cutesy “Hanukkah Song,” filled with deliberately bad rhymes and chiding wit: “David Lee Roth lights the menorah, so do James Caan, Kirk Douglas and the late Dinah Shor-ah.”If the idea of the dead Miss Shore lighting a menorah wasn’t hilarious to visualize, Sandler quickly moved on to films where he could spend 90 minutes sticking his own mug on display. Sandler’s debut starring film, “Billy Madison,” led him to leave “Saturday Night Live” in 1995 and concentrate on more movies. He scored another hit with “Happy Gilmore” and his next starring film, “The Wedding Singer,” grossed $39 million on its first weekend in release. He duplicated that feat with “Big Daddy.”"

Anthony Jeselnik,December,22,1978,Risqué,25,59.5,1394,950,"Growing up in Pittsburgh, Anthony Jeselnik didn’t think about being a stand-up. He never saw it as a career possibility. Jeselnik’s aspirations turned to writing, particularly novels.Jeselnik attended college at Tulane University in New Orleans, earning a BA in English Literature. During his senior year, he worked as a doorman at a strip club to earn money. Among the other jobs he worked before become comedian are teacher’s assistant, bookstore clerk and a chef.After college he moved to Los Angeles to break into the business as a screenwriter. After a year, he found himself frustrated. He met up with the one contact he had in Los Angeles, a college classmate of his father’s named Jimmy Brogan. Jimmy had been head writer for Jay Leno‘s Tonight Show for several years. Brogan encouraged Jeselnik to try stand-up if he wanted to break in as a writer.Even after that conversation, it still took Jeselnik a year for him to work up the nerve to attempt stand-up. A big influence on Jeselnik’s joke writing was the dark one-liners of Jack Handy. Jeselnik also found himself influenced by the concept of “The Second Smile”, voiced by original SNL Head Writer Michael O’Donoghue. A joke which both makes an audience laugh and (metaphorically) cuts their throats because of its dark edge. The first smile comes from the joke itself and the second is the throat-slitting wound. Other influences include Steven Wright and Andrew “Dice” Clay.Jeselnik’s deadpan act is structured around an alternative persona that’s ultra-confident and arrogant, a contrast to many stand-ups who are more self-deprecating. Jeselnik tries not to break the character on stage, so quite a few are surprised that he has very little in common with the character they just saw telling mean jokes.Anthony Jeselnik was the first stand-up to appear on Late night with Jimmy Fallon, where he also served as a staff writer for its inaugural first season. Jeselnik has been a regular on other late night talk shows including Jimmy Kimmel Live, Late Night with Conan O’Brien and Last Call with Carson Daly.Though Jeselnik has gotten writing jobs since, stand-up has become a goal in itself, particularly because of the opportunities it gives you for creative control.2008 saw Jeselnik named as one of Variety’s “10 Comics to Watch”, an honor that was bestowed upon him at that year’s Montreal Just For Laughs Festival.In 2009, Comedy Central featured him in a program that counted down their first “Hot List” of comedians.In September of 2011 he released his first stand-up album on Comedy Central Records entitled “Shakespeare.” It was recorded at New York City’s Upright Citizens Brigade Theater."
Ari Shaffir,?,NA,1974,Dirty,6,49.4,250,256,"Amongst other works, Ari Shaffir is probably most well-known for a series of comedy works entitled “The Amazing Racist,” the title is a play on that of the reality television show The Amazing Race. In these shorts, “The Amazing Racist” is seen acting in a manner which is overtly and ironically racist. Shaffir filmed many of his offensive encounters for the DVD National Lampoon’s Lost Reality. They were then ripped to the internet by hundreds of different nerds and seen by millions of people. Watching the videos makes many people laugh and many people very angry. Shaffir gets death threats at least once a week and loves them all. If you haven’t seen the videos, Google him. Please don’t watch them at work because you’ll get fired.Shaffir has also been featured on the HBO show Down and Dirty with Jim Norton, TBS’ show Minding the Store, ESPN Classic’s Cheap Seats: Without Ron Parker, Latino Laugh Festival on Si TV, has made a few appearances on The Opie and Anthony Show, including the greatest day of radio of all time, Babybird, and you probably have seen him on one of the dozens of national commercials he has whored himself in over the years.Shaffir’s first love is stand up though, and he is a regular at all the major clubs in Los Angeles. For the last few years, he has been touring nationally with Joe Rogan. Shaffir tends to describe his comedy as a puppet show, but way filthier and without the puppets. Shaffir wrote this biography, so every time it says “Shaffir did this,” or “Shaffir did that,” it’s really Shaffir writing it about himself. Shaffir feels like a tool for having done that.Please don’t come to the show if you’re easily offended, or if you don’t like hearing Jews tell awful stories about sexual misconduct, or if you hate fun. Everyone else, please do come."

Big Jay Oakerson,December,7,1977,Dirty,3,47.5,227,251,"Comedian Big Jay Oakerson currently has a new full length, digital-only album, “An American Storyteller” on Comedy Central Records. Oakerson’s story-based style of stand-up comedy got its start after a series of dead-end jobs, including driving strippers and escorts around his hometown of Philly.

Bill Burr,June,10,1968,Dirty,59,63.8,2452,1393,"An Irish American from Canton, Massachusetts, Bill Burr moved in 1995 to New York City to pursue his dream of a life in comedy. Eight months later, he moved to Los Angeles. There he worked on a number of film and television projects. Bill returned to New York City in 1999, to get back to his roots and concentrate on comedy.He performs over three hundred shows annually, has two movies to be released in 2006, as well as a performance on The Late Show with David Letterman.

Bill Hicks,December,16,1961,Risqué,107,69.5,2846,1250,"Born December 16th, 1961 in Valdosta, Georgia, William Melvin Hicks was the youngest of three children. By the time he was seven, Bill had lived in four states before settling in Houston. As a child Bill yearned to be a comedian. He idolized Johnny Carson and the stand-up comedy of Woody Allen.In junior high school, Bill met Dwight Slade and they became fast friends. Together, the two spent hours creating comedy routines. Bill and Dwight’s ambitions of performing in front of an audience seemed hopeless. Even though there were no comedy clubs nearby, they made recordings and sent them to local agents. One package earned them an overnight slot on the Jerry Lewis telethon, but they were underage and couldn’t perform. Finally and opportunity arrived when the Comedy Workshop opened in Houston. Chauffeured to the club by friend Kevin Booth (the only one of the three with a driver’s license), they convinced the club manager to give them a shot. Bill & Dwight became the venue’s youngest regular comics. With only a handful of performances under their belts, Dwight’s family relocated, leaving Bill to focus on his solo act.Shortly after graduating high school, Bill moved to LA to start the first phase of his love/hate relationship with the city. Performing alongside then-unknowns Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, and Gary Shandling, Bill found the going rough. After two years he had had enough and returned to Houston. Although his experience in the heart of the showbiz beast had been disappointing, Bill remained enthusiastically dedicated to stand-up comedy. He began touring, relentlessly, building a small but loyal base of fans.In 1984 with the support of Jay Leno, Bill appeared on David Letterman’s show for the first time (at the time of his death, Bill had performed on the show eleven times). He began playing more prestigious rooms and fellow comedians developed tremendous respect for his work. Hicks tried again to integrate into traditional showbiz by moving to New York which he found more agreeable than LA. There Bill stopped taking drugs, a habit he had picked up during hard years of touring. Although he attended AA meetings, Bill never renounced his drug use, explaining in performances that he had “some great times on drugs.” This blunt honesty flowed over into other areas of his performance and Bill addressed a variety of subjects with new, pure clarity.Bill’s comedy (despite his own claims to the contrary) was not about hate or pessimism. Bill was an unabashed optimist. He believed that most people were good at heart but evil forces were deliberately distracting us all from creating a better world using television, lies, tobacco and alcohol as opiates. Bill felt a revolution of thought was coming and that it was his duty, as an emissary of the truth, to bring whatever light he could to anyone who would listen. This blunt, straightforward expression of these ideas could cause clashes with less enlightened, unsuspecting audiences. The result was sometimes dangerous; Bill had his ankle broken and a gun was pointed at him on stage. Despite these experiences, he refused to compromise his material and soldiered on.His first standup comedy video, Sane Man, was recorded in 1988 before an enthusiastic crowd in Austin, Texas. Much of the material heard on his later albums is here in the embryonic stage. Bill toured the clubs even more incessantly in the early 90’s, playing 250-300 gigs a year. Although he loved performing, he hated traveling. But the effort was showing results; his legend was spreading by word of mouth. His first comedy album, Dangerous was released in 1990. That year Ninja Bachelor Party was released on VHS and HBO aired an all-Hicks episode of One Night Stand. At the Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal, Bill was a hit with audiences and critics.Soon after his Montreal gig, Bill debuted in the United Kingdom appearing in an American comedy revue. British audiences enthusiastically embraced Hicks (Bill joked that it was because of his pale skin), and he toured the country, extensively, winning the prestigious Critics Award at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival. Bill’s second album Relentless was a developmental step from Dangerous but still only hinted at what is to come. On a 1992 English tour he filmed the Revelations performance video. Although he was working harder then ever and his career was building momentum, Bill was still not reaching as large an audience as he had hoped. Meanwhile, other comedians were breaking into mass consciousness with a watered-down version of Hicks’ comedy. While it would have been lucrative for Bill to tone down his act and supersede these pretenders, he had no interest in doing so. Uncompromisingly Bill moved forward, expanding his world-view. Turning his back on the opportunity to cash in, he plowed ahead fearlessly. Bill’s material and performances evolved at a tremendous rate.In 1993 a breakthrough seemed closer than ever. Rolling Stone had declared Bill “Hot Stand-Up Comic” of the year. He began work on “Counts of the Netherworld” a high-concept talk show for British TV. He had been nominated for Stand-Up Of The Year by the American Comedy Awards for the third time. He wrote a column for the British humor magazine Scallywag and was asked to write for the political journal The Nation. Rock bands flocked to his banner; Radiohead, Rage Against the Machine and Tool professed their admiration. He had been invited by the New York Public Library for Performing Arts to speak at Lincoln Center in June of 1994. Performance films, screenplays, books and CD box sets were in various stages of discussion. Perhaps to take advantage of this synergy, Bill moved back to LA.Then, in June, Bill learned he had cancer. Choosing to keep his illness a secret, he told his family, a few close friends and went straight back to work. In August of 1993 Bill’s brother Steve flew to LA and together they packed Bill’s belongings into his jeep and drove to Little Rock, Arkansas where Bill moved into his parent’s home. He had already recorded both Arizona Bay and Rant In E Minor, with ambitious plans to mix music that he had recorded into the performance to compliment the comedy themes. He described the conceptual Arizona Bay as his Dark Side Of The Moon built around the theme of LA falling into the Pacific Ocean. Throughout the year, Bill underwent chemotherapy on a weekly basis. The tour dates didn’t let up and his writing pace accelerated.In October, Hicks taped a performance for David Letterman that became on of his most infamous moments. Returning to his hotel following the early evening taping, Bill was told that censors had cut his segment. In a 39-page letter to John Lahr of The New Yorker, Bill expressed his frustration. He had reason to be enraged; the set had been approved (twice!) by the powers that be. It would’ve been his last television appearance. His last gig was on January 6, 1994 at Caroline’s in New York City – he did not complete the series of shows.Despite his illness, Bill was at peace. He spent time with his parents, playing them the music he loved and showing them documentaries about his interests. He called friends to say goodbye and re-read J.R.R. Tolkein’s Fellowship Of The Rings.On Saturday, February 26th, 1994, Bill died. He was 32."

He starred on stage in Steve Allen’s musical “Seymour Glick is Alive and Sick,” toured the country’s comedy clubs and grinded out periodic HBO Specials (in 1989, 1992 and 1995).The years yielded experience, mounting fame, and eventually a novel about the stand-up life, “True Story.” Part Hungarian part Irish (mother Julie is Jewish, father William is Catholic), Maher’s best joke from his stand-up days was about his ethnicity. “I was brought up Catholic…with a Jewish mind. When we’d go to confession, I’d bring a lawyer in with me. “Bless me Father, for I have sinned…I think you know Mr. Cohen?”A smart but cold performer, Bill admits that it may have taken him a lot of years to make it because “I make a rotten first-through-ninth impression. I’m not someone people like right away. And I don’t warm up to people quickly.”Bill’s material soon touched on politics, and the cold-blooded approach worked on this cold-blooded business. He became one of the few young comedians to be considered iconoclastic in the smart Mort Sahl tradition. At a banquet filled with politicians Maher offered uncompromising quips. He offered a campaign slogan for Phil Gramm: “Gramm: For people who think Dole isn’t mean enough.” He added, “Senator Gramm is so tough on immigration he’s going to deport his [Asian] wife.”Another memorable line…“Marion Barry promised to get drugs off the street, one gram at a time.”And yet, he’s very sensitive to the unavoidable fact that iconoclasts don’t usually earn the respect of their targets for telling it comically like it is. He recalls a time he met President Clinton. Afterward, “I swear to God I got a feeling that he kind of gave me the evil eye. I can’t put my finger on it, maybe I’m just reading something into it. But when he shook my hand and said hello, I kinda got a look that said ‘You rat bastard what did you say the other night? I oughta kill you!’ You know…but maybe it’s just me being overly sensitive.”Maher became the host of “Politically Incorrect” on the fledgeling Comedy Central channel, a cable station that at the time was an uneven mix of old stand-up re-runs, bad movies and amateurish shows trying for MTV “edge.” Maher’s program was one of the few intelligent and funny offerings on Comedy Central—or anywhere else on cable. Playboy called it “The McLaughlin Group’ on acid….one of the few [shows] you actually wish went on longer than its allotted time.”In a Playboy interview, Maher explained why his show was so different from Oprah, Sally, and the rest. On those programs, “People aren’t talking. They’re shriving, they’re confessing, they’re exposing. But these shows are indicative of what’s happening out there. A lot of people in the country are jerking themselves off. I’ve also said that programs like The Tonight Show are no longer real talk, just cogs in the publicity mill. And they know that. But those shows started more like my show. My show is retro. In the Steve Allen-Jack Paar era, the qualification that got you on a talk show was your ability to talk.”Sometimes the talk can simply be a maddening, comic-smart retort. Maher, a supporter of capitol punishment, defends himself with a question: “Why is life precious?”The program and host won two Cable Ace awards in 1995 and Maher quickly found himself with a hit show transferred to ABC late night.The topical talk show remained a hit, benefitting from a strong lead-in from Ted Koppel’s nightly dissection of breaking news. Maher continued to foray into stand-up (the 1996 HBO special “Stuff that Struck Me Funny”) but found his own show to be quite time consuming. He also is involved in some charity work, notably People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.Maher remains one of the most interesting comedians on television with his blend of old-fashioned comic sensibilities (he knows the value of a good joke with a beginning, middle and punch-line), opinionated observations and iconoclasm, an iconoclasm that extends to his audience:“It’s always been the position of our show that the people aren’t blamed enough, and it would help them if they were. People need to be called on their own bullshit. I used to do this joke about somebody who runs for office every year telling the truth, and he never gets anywhere. His slogan is: “I’m not Santa Claus.” And he’s not president, either. The people want to be lied to. They want the guy who can lie to them in the smoothest way.”"
Billy Connolly,November,24,1942,Risqué,17,59.6,2325,1577,"Billy Connolly was born at 65 Dover Street (“on the linoleum, three floors up”) in Glasgow to Mary and William Connolly, the son of an Irish immigrant. In 1946, with their son barely four years old, Connolly’s mother abandoned his sister and him, while his father was away for the war. He and his sister, Florence (“Flo”), were then looked after by two aunts, Margaret and Mona, his father’s sisters.Connolly was brought up in the Anderston, and later Partick, districts of Glasgow. He attended St. Peter’s Primary School in Glasgow and St. Gerard’s Secondary School in Govan. At the age of 12, he decided he wanted to become a comedian but felt he didn’t fit the mold; he felt he needed to become more “windswept and interesting”. Instead, at the age of 15, he left school and became a welder in a Glasgow shipyard. Around the same time he joined the Territorial Army’s Parachute Regiment. At the medical, the doctor noted to him, “You’re not very big downstairs, are you?”, to which Connolly replied, “I thought we were only going to fight them.”In 1965, after he had completed a five-year apprenticeship as a welder, Connolly accepted a ten-week job building an oil rig in Nigeria. Upon his return to Scotland, he focused on being a folk singer.On 27 June 1969, a 26-year-old Connolly married his first wife, Iris Pressagh. In December of that year, his first child, Jamie, was born. He has four more children, all girls — one (Cara, born 1973) with Iris, and three with his second wife, Pamela: Daisy (31 December 1983), Amy (7 July 1986), and Scarlett (28 July 1988).Connolly’s career as a folk singer led to him forming a folk-pop duo called The Humblebums with a fellow musician Tam Harvey. After recording one album, Harvey left the partnership and was replaced by future rock star Gerry Rafferty. The Connolly-Rafferty version of The Humblebums recorded two more albums for independent record label Transatlantic Records. The albums were not big commercial successes but enjoyed cult status and critical acclaim. Connolly’s contributions were primarily straight-forward pop-folk with quirky and whimsical lyrics - but he had not especially focused on comedy at this point.In 1970, the Humblebums broke up with Rafferty going on to record a solo album for Transatlantic Records - Can I Have My Money Back (1971). Connolly returned to being a folk singer. His live performances featured folks songs with humorous introductions that became increasingly long in duration.The head of Transatlantic Records, Nat Joseph, who had signed the Humblebums and had nurtured their career, was concerned that Connolly find a way to develop a distinctive solo career just as his former bandmate Gerry Rafferty was doing. Joseph saw several of Connolly’s perfomances and noted his comedic skills. Joseph had successfully nurtured the recording career of another Scottish folk entertainer Hamish Imlach - and Joseph saw potential in Connolly following a similar path. He suggested to Connolly that he drop the folk-singing and focus primarily on becoming a comedian. It was a life-changing suggestion.In 1972 Joseph produced Connolly’s first solo album Billy Connolly Live! a mixture of comedic songs and short monologues that hinted at what was to follow. In late 1973, Joseph produced the breakthrough album that propelled Connolly to British stardom. Recorded at a small venue, The Tudor Hotel in Airdrie, Scotland - the record was a double-album titled Solo Concert. Releasing a live double-album by a comedian who was virtually unknown (except to a cult audience in Glasgow) was an unusual gambit by Joseph but his faith in Connolly’s talent was justified. Joseph and his Transatlantic Records marketing team - which included publicist Martin Lewis (who in 1979 would cast Connolly in The Secret Policeman’s Ball show) - successfully promoted the album to chart success on its release in 1974. Building on his cult Scottish following - Transatlantic broke Connolly throughout the UK - an unusual development for a regional comedian.In 1975, Transatlantic used the rapidity and extent of Connolly’s breakthrough to secure him a booking on Britain’s premier TV talkshow - the BBC’s Parkinson show. Connolly made the most of the opportunity and told a bawdy joke about a man who had murdered his wife and buried her bottom-up so he’d have somewhere to park his bike. This ribald humour was unusually forthright on a primetime Saturday night on British television in the mid-1970s and his appearance made a great impact and was much talked-about. He became a good friend of the host, Michael Parkinson, and now holds the joint record (with Kenneth Williams) for appearances on the programme, having been a guest on eight occasions. Referring to that debut appearance, he later said: “That programme changed my entire life.” Parkinson, in the documentary Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years, stated that people still remember Connolly telling the punchline to the ‘bike joke’ three decades after that TV appearance.Connolly’s UK success spread to other English-speaking countries - Australia, New Zealand and Canada. However his broad Scottish accent and parochial British references made success in the US improbable.His popularity in Britain endeared him to many other British entertainers including musicians such as Elton John. John at that time was trying to assist British performers he personally liked, to achieve success in the US. (He had released records in the US by veteran British pop singer Cliff Richard on his own Rocket Records label.) John tried to give Connolly a boost in America by using him as the opening act on his 1976 US tour. But the well-intentioned gesture was a failure. Elton John’s American fans had no interest in being warmed-up by an unknown comedic performer - especially a Scotsman whose accent was indecipherable to most Americans. “In Washington, some guy threw a pipe and it hit me right between my eyes”, he told Michael Parkinson two years later. “It wasn’t my audience. They made me feel about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit.”Connolly continued to grow in popularity in the UK. In 1975 he signed with Polydor Records and the label built on Transatlantic’s groundwork. Connolly continued to release live albums and he also recorded several comedic songs that enjoyed commercial success as novelty singles including parodies of Tammy Wynette’s song D.I.V.O.R.C.E. and the Village People’s In The Navy - titled In The Brownies.In 1979, Connolly was invited by producer Martin Lewis to join the cast of The Secret Policeman’s Ball - the third in the series of the Secret Policeman’s Ball fundraising shows for Amnesty International. Connolly was the first comedic perfomer in the series who was not an alumnus of the Oxbridge school of middle-class university-educated entertainers and he made the most of his appearance. His perfomance was considered to be one of the highlights of the show’s comedy album (released by Island Records in December 1979) and feature film (released by ITC Films in 1980). Appearing in the same company as long-established talents such as John Cleese and Peter Cook helped elevate the perception of Connolly as one of Britain’s leading comedic talents. Lewis also teamed Connolly with Cleese and Cook to appear in the television commercial for the album.In 1981, John Cleese and Martin Lewis invited Connolly to appear in that year’s Amnesty show The Secret Policeman’s Other Ball. Connolly’s performance was again reported as one of the highlights of the show and he was prominently featured in the subsequent comedy album (Springtime!/Island Records 1981) and UK film (UIP 1982). The commercial success of the special US version of the Secret Policeman’s Other Ball film (Miramax Films 1982) introduced Connolly to a wider American audience - attracted to the film because of the presence of Monty Python members. His on-screen presence alongside British comedic performers - who were already familiar to Anglophile comedy buffs - helped lay down a marker for Connolly’s eventual return to America in his own right eight years later.In 1985, he divorced his wife of sixteen years (they had separated four years earlier). He was awarded custody of their two children. That same year, he recorded An Audience with… which was broadcast in front of a celebrity audience on ITV. The uncut, uncensored version was subsequently released on video. In July of 1985 he performed at the Wembley leg of Live Aid - immediately preceding Elton John.In 1986 he visited Mozambique to appear in a documentary for Comic Relief. He also featured in the charity’s inaugural live stage show, both as a stand-up and portraying a willing ‘victim’ in his partner Pamela Stephenson’s act of sawing a man in half to create two dwarves.Connolly completed his first world tour in 1987, including six nights at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which was documented in the Billy and Albert video.When the Fox Network aired Freedomfest: Nelson Mandela’s 70th Birthday Celebration in 1988, Connolly was still virtually unknown in the States, but his performance drew attention, particularly from producers, and interest in him grew.In 1989, Connolly’s father died after a stroke. (His mother died four years later.) On December 20, 1989, in Fiji, Connolly married Pamela Stephenson, the New Zealand-born comedic actress whom he’d met when making a cameo appearance on the BBC sketch show Not The Nine O’Clock News, a series on which she was one of four regular performers. He had been living with her since 1981. “Marriage to Pam didn’t change me, it saved me”, he later said. “I was going to die. I was on a downwards spiral and enjoying every second of it. Not only was I dying, but I was looking forward to it.”Earlier in 1989 Connolly shaved off his trademark shaggy beard for a film role and he remained clean-shaven for several years.Although Connolly had performed in North America as early as the 1970s, and had appeared in several movies that played in American theatres, he nonetheless remained relatively unknown until 1990 when he was featured in the HBO special Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Connolly in Performance, produced by New York’s Brooklyn Academy of Music. Goldberg introduced Connolly, and his performance has been cited as the moment that officially launched his career in the States. Soon after, Connolly succeeded Howard Hesseman as the star of the sitcom Head of the Class for the 1990-1991 season, but the series was cancelled during his tenure.The following year saw Connolly and Stephenson move to Los Angeles, and the family won green cards in the Morrison Visa Lottery. In 1991, Connolly received his first (and, to date, only) leading television role as the star of Billy, another sitcom and a spinoff of Head of the Class. It lasted only a half season.On June 4, 1992, Connolly performed his 25th-anniversary concert in Glasgow. Parts of the show, and its build-up, were documented in The South Bank Show, which aired later in the year.[2]Connolly was dealt a blow in 1993 when his close friend and fishing partner, Jimmy Kent, passed away.In early January 1994, Connolly began a 40-date World Tour of Scotland, which would be broadcast by the BBC later in the year as a six-part series. It was so well received that the BBC signed him up to do a similar tour two years later, this time in Australia. The eight-part series followed Connolly on his custom-made Harley Davidson trike [1].Also in 1996, Connolly recorded a BBC special, entitled A Scot in the Arctic, in which he spends a week by himself in the Arctic Circle. A notable feature of these shows is that he strips naked in one scene in each of them, usually in some remote wilderness area where no one is likely to complain, although for Comic Relief he once danced naked around Piccadilly Circus.In 1998, Connolly’s best friend, Danny Kyle, died. “He was me dearest, dearest, oldest friend,” Connolly explained to an Australian audience on his Greatest Hits compilation, released in 2001.In November 1998, Connolly was the subject of a two-hour retrospective entitled Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years, which included tributes from Dame Judi Dench, Sean Connery, Whoopi Goldberg, Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, and Eddie Izzard. The special was released on DVD in North America in 2004.The following year, Connolly undertook a four-month, 59-date sellout tour of Australia and New Zealand. Later in the year, he completed a five-week, 25-date sellout run at London’s Hammersmith Apollo. In 2000 he travelled to Canada for two weeks on a 13-date tour.In 2001, Connolly completed the third in his “World Tour” BBC series, this time of England, Ireland and Wales, which began in Dublin and ended in Plymouth. It was broadcast the following year.Also in 2001, Pamela Stephenson’s biography of her husband, Billy, was published. It outlines his career and life, including the sexual abuse by his father that lasted from his tenth to his fourteenth years. Much of the book is about Connolly the celebrity but the account of his early years provides a context for his humour and point of view. A follow-up, Bravemouth, was published in 2003.Connolly himself is credited with writing several books, including Billy Connolly (late 1970s) and Gullible’s Travels (early 1980s), both based upon his stage act, as well as books based upon some of his “World Tour” television series. Connolly, however, has stated that his comedy does not work on the printed page.A fourth BBC series, World Tour of New Zealand, was filmed in 2004 and aired that winter. Also in his 63rd year, Connolly performed two sold-out benefit concerts at the Oxford New Theatre in memory of Malcolm Kingsnorth, who for twenty-five years was Connolly’s tour manager and sound engineer.In October 2004, during an 18-night stint at London’s Hammersmith Apollo, the comedian was criticised for making jokes about the hostage Kenneth Bigley [2]. Shortly after Connolly joked about the future beheading of the hostage, Bigley was beheaded in Iraq. Connolly does not deny that the incident happened, but claims he was misquoted. He has declined to clarify what he actually said, claiming that the context was as important as the precise words used.However, despite the bad press, in January 2005, Connolly came 8th in The Comedian’s Comedian, a poll voted for by fellow comedians and comedy insider and embarked on a major UK tour with an impressive 15 sold-out nights in Glasgow.Also in 2005, Connolly and Stephenson announced, after fourteen years of living in Hollywood, they were returning to live in the former’s native land. They purchased a 120-foot yacht with the profits from their house-sale, and now split the year between Malta and an estate in Aberdeenshire.Later in the year, Connolly topped an unscientific poll of “Britain’s Favourite Comedian” conducted by TV network Channel Five placing him ahead of performers such as John Cleese, Ronnie Barker, Dawn French, and Peter Cook.In March 2006, Connolly completed a two-month sold-out tour of Australia.During the months of May and June 2006, Connolly performed a six-week stand at the 37 Arts Theater in New York City as part of his “Too Old To Die Young” tour [3], [4]. During one show, featured on his Live in New York DVD, he revealed that his 23-year-old daughter, Daisy, was in the audience.In the Autumn of 2006, Connolly completed a month-long Canadian tour.Connolly’s first live shows of 2007 are due to take place at the Brentwood Theater in Los Angeles from March 6 to March 24.It is as a stand-up comedian that Connolly is best known. His observational comedy is idiosyncratic and often off-the-cuff. He talks about himself, who he is, where he’s been, what he thinks and how he reacts to the world around him. He has outraged audiences, critics and, of course, the media with his free use of the word “fuck”. He has used masturbation, blasphemy, defecation, flatulence, sex, his father’s illness and his aunts’ cruelty to entertain. By exploring these subjects with humour, Connolly has done much to strip away the taboos surrounding them. Yet he does not tell jokes in the conventional way. At the end of a concert the audience can be convulsed with laughter, though few can remember a specific “funny” line.One of Connolly’s most famous comedy routines is The Crucifixion, a 1973 live recording produced by Nat Joseph in which he likened Christ’s Last Supper to a drunken night out in Glasgow. The recording was banned by many radio stations at the time. Around this same time, a joke told during a television talk show appearance (about a murderer and his bike) became a sensation that, reportedly, people still remember three decades after the appearance."
Bo Burnham,August,21,1990,Risqué,14,44.7,773,958,"Bo Burnham is a teenager and comedian. in 2006, he wrote songs, posted them online, and lots of people saw them. Then, he started playing live shows. he played at colleges, clubs and theaters. People came.

Brad Williams,January,13,1984,Tame,4,41,158,227,"Brad Williams possesses something that everyone can agree is funny: a disability. Brad is a dwarf. He has appeared on numerous TV shows including Mind Of Mencia, Live at Gotham, the Tonight Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live, and Pitboss. Brad has also performed for the troops all over the world because soldiers think dwarfs are funny too.Brad was born and raised in Orange County, CA. He dropped out of college and started doing comedy at the age of 19. He toured as Carlos Mencia’s opening act for 5 years. Brad’s big break came when he would appear in numerous sketches on Comedy Central’s Mind Of Mencia TV show. Brad’s memorable roles on the show include playing a whore dwarf (“whorf”), the leader of an all dwarf basketball team, joining Mencia at a Renaissance faire, and giving a speech about his hatred of podiums.Brad’s show is high energy. Robin Williams called him “Prozac with a head.” Brad’s ability to make humorous observations on disability, relationships, sex, and race are winning over audiences and proving that anyone can overcome their shortcomings. Brad’s new hour special, “Fun Size”, premieres May 8, 2015 on SHOWTIME."

His brother was a writer on the sitcom “The King of Queens.”Regan attended Heidelberg College in Ohio, majoring in accounting and playing football for the school.

He finally completed the last ten credits to his degree in 1997.By 1981 he had immersed himself into the world of stand-up, even taking a job as a greeter and cook for the Comic Strip in South Florida. He worked out his stuff for over two years in the club, even occasionally flirting at the beginning with prop comedy.

Chris DElia,March,29,1980,Tame,3,53.9,249,213,"Chris D’Elia was 16 the first time he performed stand-up comedy. He would act up in church, so the pastor told him that he could do some time on stage afterwards if he behaved himself. Well, he didn’t behave, but he was still allowed to get on stage in front of everyone.Although his church performance was a success, it would be years before D’Elia actually pursued a career in stand-up comedy. East Coast born, West Coast raised, Chris found himself in Los Angeles, taking the stage anywhere he could—from local coffee shops to various hole-in-the-wall dive bars. Performing every night of the week, he quickly became a regular at all the clubs in Hollywood. His silly, physical humor sets him apart from other comedians. Chris explains: “I never really feel like just standing there and telling jokes. I wanna move around. In fact, it’s hard for me to write a joke where I don’t end up on the ground for some reason. Hey, at least that way I know no comics will steal my sh*t. Too many bruises.”His comedy is populated with characters and voices, perhaps due to his background in acting.Chris has toured the United States with fellow comedian Jo Koy and opened for Carlos Mencia. He has performed his stand-up on Showtime’s “Live Nude Comedy” and Comedy Central’s “Live at Gotham.”Chris’ own half-hour “Comedy Central Presents” special aired in 2011.

Chris Rock,February,7,1966,Dirty,84,72.9,3300,1225,"One of eight children and the oldest brother, Chris Rock grew up in New York’s Bed-Stuy neighborhood. Chris’ home was on one of the nice blocks in the ghetto.Chris attended an all-white school to earn a better education, but the school was in a poor white neighborhood itself.Only 17 when he first started performing in Manhattan. He and Colin Quinn would drive each other in from Brooklyn based on whoever had access to their parent’s car that night.Early in his career, Eddie Murphy saw a young Chris at the Comic Strip and liked him so much, he create a part for him in his next film Beverly Hills Cop 2.Chris was later cast in SNL. He stayed there for three seasons, but for some reason found it a difficult fit for his burgeoning talents. After he left SNL, he decided he was going to focus on stand-up,  a medium he could completely control and have the signature be all his. Prior to this time he was only doing one gig a month, enough to support himself. He went out on tour for months focusing on his writing and working road gigs - “like a fighter” as he described it. In 1997, this hard worked act culminated in the HBO special, Bring the Pain. The Emmy-winning performance marked him as the top performer of his generation.He followed up the special with another special, Bigger and Blacker, only a year later. The special is equally critically lauded.His model of doing movies and television shows to get people more interested in his stand-up is often the modus operandi for many comics working today.Stage behavior: pacing the stage, dropping the mic to the ground at the end of a performance.A student of the art form, Chris Rock keeps an iPod that is filled with all comedy albums. He worked similarly when he first took to the road after SNL, listening to Richard Pryor and Woody Allen.Chris Rock’s delivery, obstinate, staccato-gruff, is like a mean little kid who feels obligated to tell the truth—especially if it’ll shock adults. The shock laughs Rock generated made him one of the fastest rising young comics of his time.With a mischievous smile, Rock makes his earthy comments sound far less offensive than they might seem on paper. From his first comedy album:“Black people aren’t crazy. Black people do stupid things, black people snatch rope chains and rob liquor stores. Black people generally aren’t crazy. When you watch the news and hear somebody got their head chopped off, or somebody drank the blood and used the toes to play pool with, chances are that was a white guy! An old lady kicked down the stairs for a welfare check? Black guy! “Gimme dat fo’ dollah check!” Brothers’ be in jail for the stupidest shit. White guy in jail: “Embezzling funds.” Black guy, what are you in jail for: “Socks. Took me $48 worth a’ socks! My feet was feelin’ GOOD.”Chris was born in South Carolina, the first of seven children. The family moved to New York and Rock grew up in the tough Bedford-Stuyvesant district of Brooklyn. The toughest part of growing up may have been Julius Rock, Chris’s father. Julius drove a truck for the Daily News and drove his son hard, asking tough questions: “Didn’t do your homework? What kind of man you gonna be?”At the age of seven, Chris got out of the neighborhood—at least, during the day. He attended an all-white school that was a long bus ride away. “I was made to feel really bad every single day,” he recalls. But somehow the experience of being among whites enabled him to become one of the few black stand-ups to attract an equal audience among blacks and whites.Rather than exclude whites via openly racist gags ala Martin Lawrence, Rock brings them in, as the routine previously quoted shows. In Rock’s world, whites and blacks are equally ridiculous.Rock quit school at 17 and took a variety of low-wage jobs in places ranging from Red Lobster to McDonald’s. Along the way he practiced stand-up in local clubs and was discovered by Eddie Murphy while doing a gig at The Comic Strip, an East Side nightclub in Manhattan. With some help from Murphy, Chris was booked on HBO’s “Uptown Comedy Express.” He appeared in Murphy’s “Beverly Hills Cop 2.”He attracted some attention when he joined “Saturday Night Live,” developing parodies of militant blacks (Nat X) and rappers (I’m Chillin’). These routines further endeared him to white audiences, while the truth of his satires of black pretentiousness wasn’t lost on blacks either.Rock was not a natural in sketch comedy but worked at his acting skills, eventually turning in credible performances in a few films, “New Jack City” and “CB4.” Although he was certainly the first vibrant black performer on “Saturday Night Live” since Eddie Murphy, Rock was underused and restless. He bolted from the show in 1993 and joined “In Living Color.”When the show folded, Rock moved back into full-time stand-up, starring in a 1994 HBO special “Chris Rock: Big Ass Jokes” (it won a cable Ace Award) and then winning over critics with his breakthrough 1996 HBO special “Bring the Pain.” The show won two Emmy Awards and the cable channel handed him his own show. Chris married his girlfriend of many years, Malaak Compton (a UNICEF consultant) and found himself at a peak in both his professional and personal life.He’s been able to remain at this level, continuing with his own talk/sketch program for HBO, making albums, touring in stand-up and enjoying high-profile co-starring roles in movies (he added some punch to “Lethal Weapon 4” and supplied the hilariously agitated voice of a hamster in Eddie Murphy’s Doctor Dolittle.”) In 1999 he turned up on the cover of Vanity Fair and other magazines and was touted as one of the hottest comedians in the country. His “Roll with the New” comedy album won a Grammy.He’s still best in stand-up where the skinny comic grins broadly and fires grenades at all targets. Oprah Winfrey had Chris Rock as a guest, promoting his HBO show. She seemed a little flustered by the unpredictable young comic. She warned her viewers that if they tuned into his HBO show, they should know that “Anything goes! It’s not for the weak-minded!”Actually, weak-minded people of all races and creeds are the only ones who might not get a laugh from Chris Rock. But he’d just dismiss them with the title of his New York Times bestseller book: “Rock This!”Chris hopes to become a successful middle-aged and older comic, ala his idols Eddie Murphy and Bill Cosby. Says Chris, “In comedy you can keep getting better and better till the day you die. It’s not like you’ll be sidelined because you have a torn rotator cuff. My job is to make people laugh.” in 2008, Chris Rock attempted something different for his next special “Kill The Messenger.” The special cross cuts between three performances from his world comedy tour in London, New York and South Africa, often with him delivering the set-up of a joke in one city and the punchline in another."

Colin Quinn,June,6,1959,Risqué,22,62.3,2447,1481,"A born New Yorker, Colin Quinn grew up in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. Before stand-up Quinn worked as a bartender.Quinn started performing stand-up in 1985, right after his first year of college. A friend of his coaxed him into starting performing together. He claims his first performance was in jail, after cops picked up for buying drugs prior to his intended first performance at the Improv. He told the cops that he was a comic and ended up performing for them, to silence, in his jail cell.In 1987 he became a co-host of “Remote Control”, a game show on MTV. Friends and fellow comics Adam Sandler and Denis Leary often made guest appearances on the show as various characters. He worked on the program for three years and continues his relationship with MTV with a sports comedy show entitled “Colin Quinn’s Manly World.”Early in the 90s, Quinn hosted the A&E stand-up show “Caroline’s Comedy Hour.” One of his writers for the show was Jon Stewart.Colin Quinn, as a good friend of Jerry Seinfeld, had a prominent presence in Seinfeld’s documentary on stand-up “Comedian.” On the DVD for “Comedian”, Quinn appears on the commentary track with Seinfeld.In 1995, Quinn became a writer and feature player on “Saturday Night Live.” In 1997, he was upgrade to a cast player and in 1998 he became the anchor for Weekend Update, the fake news segment. He succeeded fellow stand-up Norm MacDonald. Quinn left the show in 2000.Colin made his Broadway debut with a one-man show entitled “Colin Quinn: An Irish Wake” in 1998. The show portrays, often unflinchingly, the narrow failings of the working class Irish that he grew up with in his Brooklyn neighborhoodIn 2002, Quinn created a prime-time sketch comedy show for NBC, but the show only lasted for three episodes. Along with poor ratings, some say NBC nixed the show due to racial content that made some advertisers nervous.Quinn joined Comedy Central’s late night line-up in 2003 with his show “Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn.” The show appeared to be a round table discussion on he day’s issues, but was, at it’s heart, a bull session between stand-ups. Quinn modeled the show on late night conversations he would have with other comics at the Olive Tree, a restaurant above New York’s Comedy Cellar. Many of the comics who appeared on the show are close friends with Quinn. Regular guests included Patrice O’Neal, Nick Di Paolo, Rich Vos, Jim Norton. Many of these regulars ae close friends with Quinn, and took great joy in insulting him and each other. Tough Crowd ran for two years, airing it’s final episode Novermber 4, 2004 much to the dismay of those who grew to love Tough Crowd and its “cringe” style of comedy.Quinn, who was a frequently drinker in his youth, and has since given up alcohol after having many episodes where he blacked out and, occasionally, arrested.A trademark of Quinn’s performing style is his gravelly voice and his mumbling, mush-mouthed delivery.In 2010, Colin Quinn began performing his one-man show “Long Story Short” Off-Broadway.

After his cousin was shot, Hughley turned his life around, got a GED and a job and, after prompting by his wife, LaDonna, tried his hand at stand-up comedy. He claims from the first time he picked up a mic, he knew he should be a comedian. His comedy was a huge success and in 1992 he was picked to be the first host of BET’s Comicview. He also appeared in the 3rd season of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air as an old friend of Will Smith trying out for an audition as a comedian.By 1997, Hughley went on a nationwide stand-up comedy tour with Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer, and Bernie Mac as the Kings of Comedy. The comedy act was later put into a film by Spike Lee called The Original Kings of Comedy.In 1998, Hughley was given his own TV sitcom, The Hughleys, on ABC.

Dana Carvey,April,2,1955,Tame,29,64.9,2609,1412,"An impressionist/actor, Dana Carvey became one of the more versatile members on “Saturday Night Live” in the late 1980’s, perfecting both mimcry of personalities and his own characters. He seemed to specialize in know-it-alls. From real people like the loud Robin Leach and the lecturing George Bush to his own creations the loud bodybuilder Hans and the lecturing “Church Lady,” Dana carved out a gallery of self-important people.He admitted, “That’s what the real fun of playing these characters is. It’s making fun of those people who really feel they have the truth and the answers for everybody. Self-righteous, arrogant, “I’m superior to you” people drive me nuts.” Carvey even did an imitation of “Saturday Night Live” co-star Dennis Miller. Another favorite was Andy Rooney, spouting “Ya ever wonder why people’s faces are made of flesh? Why can’t people’s faces be made of Play-Doh? That way, if someone said something that annoyed you, you could just reach out, and, well, mess up their face a little…”Born in Missoula, Montana, Carvey grew up in San Carlos, California, and began performing stand-up in San Francisco in 1978. He found some acting work as well, taking small parts in films (a waiter in “This is Spinal Tap”) and the role of Mickey Rooney’s grandson in “One of the Boys.” A sitcom pilot, “Whacked Out” co-starring Desi Arnaz Jr. never made it to series even with Lucille Ball urging the audience to laugh. Carvey got married in 1983, and a few years later won recognition for playing the likable probation officer in “Tough Guys” with Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster.On “Saturday Night Live” Carvey was able to use his mild personality to underline his satire. Jay Leno enthused, “He’s got a real pie-in-the-face AM sense of humor and a sophisticated FM routine for people who appreciate their comedy when it’s more subtle.” His two most popular routines, as George Bush and as The Church Lady, were both broad and quietly satiric at the same time. Through the gags, Carvey’s gestures and expressions captured the characters’ underlying tensions. He gave Bush a lot of restless hand movements and the catch-phrase “it wouldn’t be prudent.” He explained that he arrived at Bush by performing “a cross between Mister Rogers and John Wayne’s cadence.”The Church Lady, with her tensely twisted half-smile and feverish sense of etiquette and propriety was based on someone Carvey and his Lutheran family met in church: “I remember when my family would be late to church, we’d be kind of embarrassed, and we’d have to say, ‘Hey, we had a barbecue, lighten up!’ And those church ladies would go, “Oh, I see, we come to church when it’s conveeeenient!”As the moderator of a TV talk show called “Church Chat,” The Church Lady (rarely called by her name, Enid Strict), interviewed guests with tongue-in-cheek sarcasm and cold friendliness. To one sexy actress, she huffed, “We like ourselves, don’t we? Yes, especially with our bosoms pressed together and offered for the explicit viewing of the chestal area. Who dressed you this morning, Sally? Could it be—Satan?” When Rob Lowe appeared as a guest, fresh from a scandal involving pornographic video tapes he made with an adoring fan, The Church Lady took him over her knee as the crowd laughed and applauded. “Get out of his buttocks, Satan!” she shouted.Her catch phrase was the artificially pleasant and drily mocking, “Isn’t that special?” It made Carvey the most “special” member of the new “Saturday Night Live” cast."
Daniel Tosh,May,29,1975,Risqué,95,59.3,2468,1694,"Daniel Tosh grew up in Titusville, Florida with his brother and two sisters. Tosh was born in Germany. His father was a preacher and his mother a nurse. Tosh began performing stand-up while attending the University of Central Florida after a late night talk with a friend. Tosh saw stand-up as a route past a nine to five gig that he had no interesting in living.His first time performing stand-up was actually at a music open mic, where he describes his act as having unintended accompaniment by rim shots from one of the band’s drummers. He began to frequent open mics in Orlando, particularly the comedy club Bonkers.Tosh graduated in 1996 with a degree in marketing (a selection he claims he made because he thought it would be “the easiest”). Daniel continued to devote himself to stand-up, eventually attracting interest from the former manager for comic Bill Hicks. The manager had not taken on a client since Hicks’ death. Tosh also soon generated enough interest for him to be invited in 1998 to the New Faces show at the Just For Laugh Comedy Festival in Montreal.At age 23 Tosh decided to best continue his comedy career he would need to either move to New York or Los Angeles. An avid surfer, Tosh chose LA. (Tosh continues to surf today at his home in Hermosa Beach.)His first introduction to a national TV audience was in 2001, as a guest on CBS’ Late Show with David Letterman. He’s since done all of the major late night talk shows including the Tonight Show, Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Jimmy Kimmel Live and the Late Late Show (Craig Kilorn version).

By continually introducing new material into his act, Tosh believe it keep him freshm engaged and sane.He’s a regular performer at the Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, where he often works out new material.Tosh, when not touring, resides in Los Angeles with his dogs, Castro and Eva, who are both Havanese."
Dave Attell,January,18,1965,Dirty,83,70.7,2915,1210,"Dave Attell was born in Queens and raised on Long Island, specifically Rockville Centre.In 1987, Dave Attell graduated from New York University with a degree in communications. Uncertain of what exactly he should do with the degree, he ended up gravitating towards stand-up. He supported himself by waiting tables, cleaning houses and temping.Attell’s first experience at stand-up was at Long Island’s Governor’s Comedy Cabaret, where like many first time comics he bombed. Many open mike nights were late at night, which Attell found to suit him well. Particularly the crowd, which responded to the twisted material that he naturally gravitated towards.Because of his unique style, which is sometimes relentless about perverse sex and eviscerating crowds that object to it, Attell became heavily admired in the comedy community. He was the comic that comics would want to see - a “comic’s comic.”Attell worked as a writer for SNL in the mid 90s, but didn’t let it get in the way of his stand-up. He would often sneak out to clubs to perform after his writing duties were done.Dave Attell was named one of the “25 Funniest People in America” by Entertainment Weekly Magazine.In 2001, Dave Attell used his after-hours life as a road comic to inspire his Comedy Central travel show “Insomniac with Dave Attell.” “Insomniac” always started with Attell performing stand-up in a local club in a city. These sets were presented more naturalistic, with the occasional rough patches kept in. Attell would sometimes even comment that after that set he needed a drink.In the rest of the episode, Attell would seek out the charms of the city he found himself in, be they alcohol, bizarre clubs, weird jobs or just people on the street. Attell liked to describe it as, “Wild On for Ugly People.” Insomniac ran for four seasons with Attell ending it because the show had gotten too successful and made getting real footage of Attell hanging out in bars impossible. But he did continue Insomniac in a new way, by taking it international with specials in Germany, Brazil and Japan.The travelogue was popular and drove audiences to see Attell perform live. After the fourth season of Insomniac, Dave Attell joined Lewis Black for the Comedy Central Live tour. The tour brought Attell to theaters, with larger crowds than comedy club and less distractions as well. Though Attell enjoys performing in theaters and wants to perform in more of them, he feels clubs are really his element - where he can go off script a bit and play with situations happening in the club. The late Mitch Hedberg, a fellow comic, also joined the pair for a few of the dates.In 2003, Attell created his first comedy album for the nascent Comedy Central Records entitled “Skanks for the Memories.” The CD was recorded at the Comedy Works in Denver.Attell later headlined an Insomniac tour for Comedy Central. Joining him on the thirty-five city tour as an opener was Sean Rouse. The tour culminated with a two hour concert at the Las Vegas House of Blues, where Attell and Rouse were joined by Greg Geraldo and Dane Cook.Attell’s comedy is not so much storytelling, as it is jokes.

Dave Chappelle,August,24,1973,Dirty,142,73,3187,1179,"David “Dave” Chappelle (born August 24, 1973) is an American comedian, satirist and actor who rose to top stardom in 2003 with the debut of Comedy Central’s Chappelle’s Show. He received two Emmy nominations during the 2003-04 TV season and another nomination for the 2004-05 season.Dave Chappelle was born in Washington, D.C.. His father, William Chappelle was a professor of voice and music at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. His mother, Yvonne Seon is a Unitarian Universalist minister. During young Dave’s formative years, his comic inspiration came from various comedy idols, particularly Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and also the Warner Brothers cartoon character Bugs Bunny.At the age of 14, he gathered the courage to perform stand-up comedy at Harlem’s famed Apollo Theater. The performance resulted in him being booed off the stage, but in the Inside the Actors Studio interview, broadcast February 12, 2006, he described the experience as an enlightening moment that gave him the courage to continue his show business aspirations.After his parents separated, Chappelle stayed in Washington with his mother, while spending summers with his father in Yellow Springs. In June 1991, he graduated from Washington’s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, a renowned performing arts high school, where he majored in theatre arts.Within a year of his graduation, Dave Chappelle appeared, at the age of 19, in small, but showy roles in his first two films, 1993’s Robin Hood: Men in Tights (released on July 28) and Undercover Blues (released on September 10, although it was apparently filmed before Robin Hood). On the strength of his performances in these films, Chappelle was offered the role of Bubba in Forrest Gump, which was in a pre-production stage. Not realizing the impact this future Best Picture Oscar would have, and concerned about what seemed to be a racially-demeaning portrayal of the character, he took the advice of fellow comedian Bill Cosby in turning down the part, ultimately played by Mykelti Williamson. He has since admitted to deeply regretting the decision. Chappelle played another supporting movie role in 1994’s little-seen Getting In.He attracted the attention of TV network executives with his exuberant performance in the March 14, 1995 episode of ABC’s highly rated sitcom Home Improvement. The storyline had Chappelle and actor Jim Breuer play a duo of amateur filmmakers whose every move with their girlfriends (As directed by Tim) resulted in comic mayhem. The characters’ single outing in the episode proved so popular that ABC decided to star them in their own half-hour sitcom Buddies premiering on Tuesday, March 5, 1996. Jim Breuer however, was replaced with Christopher Gartin as Dave’s “buddy” after subsequent rehearsals. The unique comic timing and chemistry that Chappelle had with Breuer in the Home Improvement episode was not present with Gartin, and Breuer’s abrupt firing exacerbated ill will and prevented Chappelle and Gartin from developing the rapport and comedic chemistry necessary for the characters’ believability and likeability. The dilemma was reflected in the disappointing ratings. When a move to Wednesday night failed to improve its performance, Buddies was off the air on March 27 after a broadcast history of only four episodes out of thirteen that were produced. Nine years later, in May 2005, ten of the episodes were released on a single-disc DVD to capitalize on Chappelle’s new-found fame.He later appeared as the nightclub comedian in the remake of The Nutty Professor, had a minor role in Con Air, had a supporting role in Martin Lawrence’s Blue Streak, and co-wrote (with Neal Brennan), produced (uncredited) and starred in Half Baked, a cult film about a group of pot-smoking best friends trying to get their friend out of jail. Since he remained in contact with his Buddies co-star Jim Breuer, Chappelle decided to try recapturing the special comic harmony that they generated two years earlier by offering Breuer the co-starring role in Half Baked.Chappelle appeared as himself in an episode of The Larry Sanders Show, in which he and the executives of the show’s nameless television network satirized the treatment that scriptwriters and show creators were subject to, as well as the executives’ knee-jerk stereotyping when it came to race. In 1998, he played a supporting role as Tom Hanks’ best friend and confidant in You’ve Got Mail.In 2003, Chappelle debuted his own weekly television show on Comedy Central called Chappelle’s Show. The show parodies many aspects of American culture such as racial stereotypes and slurs, including his African-American heritage. This, combined with Chappelle’s pointed social and political commentary, quickly helped garner the show’s critical and commercial success. Chappelle’s Show also gained a large hip-hop following and featured progressive rappers such as Dead Prez, Talib Kweli, The Roots, Mos Def, and Kanye West. Along with comedy skits, the show also had musical performances, which spotlighted musical guests such as Wu-Tang Clan, Busta Rhymes, Outkast, Common, De La Soul, Fat Joe, Anthony Hamilton, DMX, Snoop Dogg, Erykah Badu, and John Mayer. Chappelle can even be heard on the track “The Mic” by the Roots as well as “Right About Now” by Talib Kweli. In addition, he intros in the song “Keynote Speaker” on Talib Kweli’s album Quality.By the end of the second season, it was one of the highest-rated shows on basic cable, with a greater audience share than South Park on Comedy Central.[citation needed] Additionally, the DVD set, Chappelle’s Show Season One Uncensored!, became the best-selling DVD of a television show to date, overtaking the previous best-selling, The Simpsons first season DVD. It had sold over 3 million copies [1]. Due to the show’s popularity, Comedy Central’s parent company Viacom reportedly offered Chappelle a $55 million contract (giving Chappelle a share of DVD sales) to continue production of Chappelle’s Show for two more years while allowing him to do side projects. Chappelle had stated that sketches are not his favorite form of comedy, and that the characteristics of the show’s format were somewhat like short films.Chappelle portraying the late Rick James in the infamous Rick James sketch.Chappelle portraying the late Rick James in the infamous Rick James sketch.The comedian stunned fans and the entertainment industry when he abruptly left during production of the third season of Chappelle’s Show. Chappelle has since stated that he was unhappy with the direction the show had taken, claiming pressure from network executives regarding the show’s content. Chappelle left the United States to visit South Africa. His decision triggered reports of mental or drug problems with the actor, which Chappelle later denied. On May 11, 2005, news sources reported that Chappelle had checked himself into a psychiatric facility in South Africa, which Chappelle has since repeatedly denied. On May 14, Time Magazine announced that one of their reporters had interviewed Chappelle in South Africa, and the comedian said no psychiatric treatments were occurring or necessary. Chappelle has stated that his reasons for visiting South Africa were to reflect on his life and career.On August 3, co-star Charlie Murphy gave an interview to TV Guide stating that he believed that Dave Chappelle was finished with Chappelle’s Show and would not be returning.Later in the year, Chappelle had returned home and was performing impromptu shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Newport, Kentucky. He was interviewed for Inside the Actors Studio on December 18, 2005 at Pace University’s Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts. The show premiered on February 12, 2006. Chappelle stated that the death of his father had an impact in his decision to go to South Africa to get away from the stress of stardom, stating that he had not received a chance to mourn his father’s death. He also said the rumors that he was in drug or psychiatric treatment only persuaded him to stay in South Africa.He was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey on her show on February 3, 2006 in his first televised interview since his departure from Chappelle’s Show. He stated in the interview that he “wasn’t crazy” but the environment was “incredibly stressful”. He continued:“I would go to work on the show and I felt awful every day, that’s not the way it was. ... I felt like some kind of prostitute or something. If I feel so bad, why keep on showing up to this place? I’m going to Africa. The hardest thing to do is to be true to yourself, especially when everybody is watching.”Chappelle also admitted to Oprah that he felt some of his sketches were socially irresponsible. He singled out the “pixie sketch” (in which it implied everyone has a pixie that appears to them and encourages them to act in a way stereotypical for their race) and said during the filming of the blackface pixie sketch, a white crew member was laughing. Chappelle said “it was the first time I felt that someone was not laughing with me but laughing at me.” He also said that during the sketch he was called nigger by one of the other non-important cast members.During these interviews, Chappelle did not rule out returning to Chappelle’s Show to “finish what we started”, but promised that he would not return without changes to the production, such as a better working environment. He also stated he would like to donate half of the DVD sales to charity, and to people that supported him. Chappelle expressed disdain at the possibility of his material from the unfinished third season being aired, saying that to do so would be “a bully move”, and that he would not return to the show if Comedy Central were to air the unfinished material. On July 9, 2006, Comedy Central aired the first episode of Chappelle’s Show: The Lost Episodes. An uncensored DVD release of the episodes was made available on July 25.Chappelle has stated that he has no intention of leaving Yellow Springs, Ohio, his current residence (see below). “Turns out you don’t need $50 million to live around these parts, just a nice smile and a kind way about you. You guys are the best neighbors ever”, he stated at a blues and jazz festival in the town in mid-September 2006, “That’s why I came back and that’s why I’m staying.”Chappelle was the subject of the Michel Gondry-directed documentary Dave Chappelle’s Block Party which chronicles a Chappelle-hosted event in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn on 18 September 2004. The highlight of the event was the reunion of popular ‘90s rap group The Fugees. Chappelle toured several cities in February and March 2006 to promote the film under the moniker “Block Party All-Stars featuring Dave Chappelle”. Universal Pictures’ genre division Rogue Pictures released the film in the United States on March 3, 2006.Chappelle has made an appearance on Def Poetry. He performed two poems, titled Fuck Ashton Kutcher and How I Got the Lead on “Jeopardy!.”In 1998, Chappelle converted to Islam. He told Time Magazine in a May 2005 interview, “I don’t normally talk about my religion publicly because I don’t want people to associate me and my flaws with this beautiful thing. And I believe it is beautiful if you learn it the right way.”[5]Chappelle has commented on being a computer and video game enthusiast, some of his favorites being NBA Street, Street Fighter and Grand Theft Auto. He also is a World of Warcraft enthusiast.[6] On Chappelle’s Show, he has paid homage a few different times to various video games. One was to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, in which he plays the main character that steals a car to go to work. Another was to the game Street Hoops, in which he challenges and beats a child with cancer. In a 2Pac rap sketch, a lyric mentions “run up in yo’ spot like CJ from San Andreas”.He lives with his wife Elaine (who is of Filipino descent[7]) and two sons (one is named Sulayman[8]) on a 65-acre (26-hectare) farm just outside Yellow Springs, Ohio. When he is not touring or engaged in filming for television or the big screen, Chappelle can be seen in the shops and markets of the small college town known as a countercultural center.Chappelle likes to skateboard as a hobby and says he tries to find skateparks in the cities he performs in. He made an appearance skateboarding in the Signature Video Magazine Volume 1. The video features a short clip of Dave skating at Project 58 in Raleigh, North Carolina. He made another appearance skating on the first episode of Chappelle’s Show during the credits as Clayton Bigsby, black white supremacist."
David Cross,April,4,1964,Dirty,116,66.6,2754,1383,"Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, David made his way to Boston to study film at Emerson College but quickly dropped out and started doing stand-up full time. He moved to Los Angeles to write on The Ben Stiller Show where he shared the posthumous Emmy (it was given after the show was canceled) with the show’s other writers.Continuing in the sketch tradition, he created (along with Bob Odenkirk) the groundbreaking show for HBO, Mr. Show with Bob & David. The show ran for four years and garnered several Emmy nominations. He has also released two comedy cd’s on the Subpop label, Shut Up You Fucking Baby and It’s Not Funny.   Shut Up…. was nominated for a Grammy Award.  Both continue to sell exceptionally well and have garnered rave reviews.David has appeared in such films as Men in Black (both 1 & 2), Waiting for Guffman, Scary Movie 2, Ghost World, and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.  He can be seen most recently in She’s The Man for Dreamworks, School for Scoundrels for the Weinstein Company, and Curious George for Universal.  Upcoming projects include Todd Haynes’ rumination on the life of Bob Dylan, I’m Not There and Zack Penn’s poker farce, The Grand.  On the television side, David appeared in the Emmy Award winning Fox Network comedy, Arrested Development, as Tobias Fünke.  Most recently, he wrote, produced and starred in the Comedy Central animated series Freak Show which was co-created by David and Jon Benjamin."
Demetri Martin,May,25,1973,Tame,116,57.7,2408,1767,"Growing up in New Jersey to a strong Greek family, Demetri Martin was a dutiful son. He excelled in school, bused tables at the family restaurant and was an altar boy. His studies first brought him to Yale University and later, New York University School of Law. Despite attending the law school on a full scholarship, Martin quit with only one year left to completing his degree. He had found something he enjoyed - stand-up comedy. (Part of the strain of law school showed when Martin attended class in a gorilla suit one day.)Though his family reluctantly accepted his decision, it did put the strain on the relationship with his wife (who was his high school sweatheart). Martin shared the difficulties in his marriage and the subsequent divorce in his second one man show “Assembly Rooms.”Now he travels to places where people speak English so that he can tell his jokes to them. He had a job as a writer at Late Night with Conan O’Brien. He performed on the Late Show with David Letterman, Comedy Central Presents Demetri Martin, Late Night with Conan O’Brien and some of the other television shows that have comedians.Sometimes he gets to appear on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart as their resident trendspotter. Also, they allow him to have free food from their offices.Demetri won trophies for comedy. One of them was the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh International Fringe Festival in 2003. The magazine Entertainment Weekly put him on the list of the 25 funniest people in America. He was number 21.Demetri has brown hair. He is allergic to peanuts. He loves making things. And he knows at least 20 people who are funnier than he is (in America).Martin is especially well known for his somewhat methodical approach to his work and his life. He is an inveterate puzzle solver and it often influences how he approached the construction of his jokes, the testing of his capacities and, occasionally, the numerical measurement of his life."

Dick Gregory,October,12,1932,Tame,6,43.8,1544,1981,"Stand-up wasn’t perceived as a gutsy, heroic, “relevant” art form until three men began challenging audiences with hard-hitting satire. Mort Sahl handled the political revolution, Lenny Bruce challenged sexual and religious conventions, and Dick Gregory was the voice of the rising civil rights movement.Born in St. Louis, Dick seemed destined for a sports career. He broke track records and by the time he reached Southern Illinois University was judged one of the country’s best running the half-mile and mile. In the Army he mc’d shows and performed comedy, and when he got out rented out nightclubs to produce his own shows in Chicago. Liberal audiences seeking the truth from Bruce and Sahl seemed to encourage stronger comedy. When Gregory subbed for Irwin Corey at the Chicago Playboy Club, he gave it to them.“I understand there are a good many Southerners in the room tonight,” he said. “I know the South very well. I spent 20 years there one night.” Gregory told broad jokes about race, laughing at the myth of Santa Claus: “You know damn good and well ain’t no white man comin’ in our neighborhood after midnight.” But he also told dangerously strong one-liners, like the definition of “a Southern moderate. That’s a cat who’ll lynch you from a low tree.” His anger and his ironic sense of humor showed in his classic tale of visiting a Southern diner: “I sit down, a blonde waitress walked over to me. I said, “I’d like two cheeseburgers.’ She said, “We don’t serve colored people down here.” I said, “I don’t eat colored people nowhere!”Some characterized Gregory as “The black Mort Sahl” for his political gags. Of the Johnson vs Goldwater presidential race, he said, “You got two girls and one is a full-time prostitute and the other is a weekend prostitute. If you choose the lesser of two evils and marry the weekend prostitute, you’re only fooling yourself if you don’t think you’re marrying a whore.”Like Sahl and Bruce, Dick Gregory was pleased to see “the message” get across, but restless over how much of it was sinking in. He also began to question the value of jokes in producing real change. “We didn’t laugh Hitler out of existence,” he said. “There will be a cure found for cancer, only it won’t be good humor.” Through the 60’s he shifted his energies toward writing books, marching, and giving speeches. He ran for president in 1968. His comedy performances turned into lectures, and he quit stand-up in the early 70’s.He remained active in the civil rights movement, and made most of his money through lectures and his new business, “The Bahamian Diet.” Noted for his many protest fasts against the Vietnam War, world hunger, hostage-taking in Iran and the death penalty, the vegetarian Gregory became an expert on nutrition (and how to go from 170 pounds to 98 without killing himself). He made a name for himself as a diet expert when, in 1987, he became involved with Walter Hudson, a 1400 pounder so heavy he got stuck in his own doorway at home. Hudson lost 900 pounds. Sales of Gregory’s diet products zoomed up to give him $40,000 in profits each month.While some wondered why Dick was selling diet products instead of more typically flying to Biafra to call attention to the needy there, he defended his position: “When you see businessmen in airports with the bloated bellies and bald heads—that’s malnutrition too."
Donald Glover,September,25,1983,Tame,10,54.6,985,819,"Donald Glover is an actor, comedian, and writer. He was born in California on Edwards Air Force Base and moved to Atlanta when he was four. There he studied drama and the process of writing short plays, which he continued to study at New York University’s Dramatic Writing program at Tisch School of the Arts. Donald also studied improvisation and comedy writing with the Upright Citizen’s Brigade Theatre in New York and had the pleasure of improvising with the likes of Amy Poehler and Horatio Sanz. He’s also performed on ” Late Night with Conan O’Brien” multiple times and was named one of Variety’s “10 Comics to Watch.”Donald was hired as a staff writer on the show ” 30 Rock” while he was still a Resident Assistant at NYU.

Doug Stanhope,March,25,1967,Dirty,59,58.4,2276,1621,"Doug Stanhope grew up Worcester, Massachusetts. His parents separated when he was young and he spent time going between his mother and father. His mother let him and his brother read things like Hustler Magazine when he was younger. The tasteless cartoon in there are among some of Doug’s early influences.A high school dropout, Doug took a train to LA when he turned 18, in hopes of becoming an actor. Six months later, he went back home. He soon moved to Las Vegas, attracted by the fun the city promises. He had quite of bit of it, one night coming home to his girlfriend after marrying another woman during a late night booze-filled adventure.In 1990, while working as a telemarketer, Stanhope began attending open mikes at Las Vegas’s Escape Lounge II. After a few times requesting to go up, Stanhope finally wrote some jokes to perform. His first material has been self-described as “jack-off jokes.” That first week as a stand-up, Stanhope performed six times.Stanhope’s material is marked by an almost unflinching honesty, touching upon his own drug habits and sexual habits. His social and political views are contrarian, but always sincere. The twisted things he says are what he believes, he’s come to them using his own dark logic. His belief in what he says - it’s not just “material” - is probably why sometimes he gets visceral responses from audiences, often inducing walkouts not ready for the truth as Stanhope sees it.Doug Stanhope taped a Comedy Central Presents special in 2001. He often describes the process for the special as frustrating because of the censors and lawyers. A bit of his on suicide had to be cut, because of fears of a lawsuit if a viewer actually followed through afterwards. He was also dissatisfied with the network’s stance that drugs could only be talked about negatively.2002 was a big year for Stanhope. He was named one of the Top Ten Comics To Watch by both Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. And at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland, he was awarded the Strathmore Press Award.Though Stanhope is a committed stand-up, he’s strayed into TV and other gigs, mostly just to have the experience (and the paycheck, of course). Among them are “The Man Show” with his friend Joe Rogan and hosting the flashing festivities of “Girls Gone Wild”. He once appeared on Jerry Springer with a completely fictitious story.In 2005, he began organizing events featuring himself and other comics who worked in their own territory, even if the audiences wouldn’t come with them. He called them “The Unbookables.” Among them is the comic Sean Rouse. In 2006, Stand-Up Records released the first Unbookables CD entitled “Morbid Obscenity”, a benefit disk where the proceed went to help a friend of the Unbookables get liposuction surgery.Frustrated by the current politcal situation but not quite ready to defect to Costa Rica, Doug Stanhope announced he was running for President in July of 2006 as a Libertarian. It was not meant as a joke, he began to research campaign law and voter outreach through the web and in speaking engagements beyond his stand-up. However, in May 2007 he withdrew after realizing that current election laws would not allow him to collect money as a stand-up if he was campaigning for office.As Stanhope has grown in reputations, he has taken to performing in more rock and roll venues rather than comedy clubs. He has great distaste for how most comedy club package their shows for mass audiences, describing them as “Adult Chuck E. Cheeses.”In 2007, Showtime aired his stand-up special “No Refunds.” The show was shot at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York, a city that Stanhope dislikes and rarely performs in. A DVD release followed a week later.Stanhope often draws comparisons to Bill Hicks and Lenny Bruce, but he mostly doesn’t see it - save for the willingness to take on what some think is difficult material.Stanhope dislikes crowds and traffic, so in 2005, Stanhope moved from Los Angeles and now lives in the one stop light town of Bisbee, Arizona."
Eddie Griffin,July,15,1968,Dirty,14,47.8,1882,2053,"Eddie Griffin has become one of the most well-known celebrities in Hollywood. But his rise to the top of the industry has been an interesting one.A popular comic turned actor who started his career on-stage as a dare, funnyman Eddie Griffin’s memorable supporting roles in such films as Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo have built the comedian an ever-growing fan base and a path to his first starring role in 2002’s Undercover Brother.Born in Kansas City, MO, Griffin’s career began when he accepted a dare to take the stage on amateur night at a local comedy club. Soon developing a personal style reminiscent of such classic comics as Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx, Griffin gained further exposure opening for comic Andrew Dice Clay on a 22-city tour and later in a series of impromptu performances at Los Angeles’ popular Comic Store.Quickly following with performances on HBO’s Russell Simmons’ Def Comedy Jam and a Cable Ace Award-nominated special, Griffin began branching out into acting. Roles in such films as The Last Boy Scout (1991), Coneheads (1993), and Jason’s Lyric (1994) soon led to a sitcom (Malcom and Eddie) in 1996, and Griffin’s film appearances became more frequent. After headlining 2001’s Double Take alongside Orlando Jones, Griffin earned his leading-man status, and with his role as Anton Jackson in 2002’s Undercover Brother, it seemed as if Griffin had conquered not only the stage, but the silver screen as well. In addition to his comedic skills, Griffin is also a gifted dancer and choreographer.This next year promises to be a busy one for Griffin, with several movie releases including Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo. The film will be hitting theaters in August 2005."
Eddie Izzard,February,7,1962,Tame,65,61.6,2463,1534,"The youngest son of an English couple, Eddie Izzard was born overseas in Aden, Yemen. His early life was spend mostly in England, though he spent the first five years in the country in Northern Ireland until the political climate made the family decide to move. Soon afterwards in 1968, Izzard’s mother died of cancer.In the wake of his loss, Izzard was comforted by the humor of stand-ups like Steve Martin and Richard Pryor.When Izzard went to University, he began exploring stand-up comedy, using the work of Billy Connolly as a base for him to riff new material from. His studies to become an accountant (like his father) suffered and he soon was dropped from the University of Sheffield. Izzard became a street performer in both England and the United States.Izzard brought his act in from streets to the comedy clubs in 1987, making his first appearance at London’s The Comedy Store.After six years his work became lauded, winning his first British Comedy Award in 1993 for his show “Live at the Ambassadors.” A second followed for his next show “Definite Article.” The tour for the alter brough him to New York City and to the attention of HBO.For a year worked up a new show, touring with it in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The result, “Dress to Kill”, premiered on the premium cable channel HBO in 1999. It went on to win two Emmy Awards for both  performance and writing and made him a star in the States.Izzard has been able to diversify his stand-up success into acting work, appearing in films and on television, particularly in the drama “The Riches” for the basic cable channel F/X. He also performed in plays on London’s West End, most notability to stand-up fans as Lenny Bruce in a 1999 revival of the play “Lenny.”Izzard’s stand-up is marked by his ability to improvise on stage, riffing off of a central idea and discovering jokes along the way. Successful ad-libs from previous nights are brought back in for subsequent performances, but there is always some free association in each of his performances. His material tends not to the political, but to history, often talking about the development of man. The target for Izzard’s comedic eye vary, extending anywhere from animals to religion. Some see this stream-of-conscious style is very similar to the sketches of Monty Python, although all of their work was scripted. (John Cleese himself actually named Izzard the lost Python.)Though a cross dresser, Izzard is not gay. Izzard draws a distinction between an “executive” or “action” transvestite and a “weirdo” transvestite. He counts himself in the earlier variety, as he’s not sexually aroused by wearing women’s clothing. He just simply enjoys wearing make-up and women’s clothing. As for his sexual orientation, Izzard asserts that he is a “male lesbian.”Izzard also speaks French and German, and has performed his stand-up shows in both."
Eddie Murphy,April,3,1961,Dirty,45,70.1,3121,1329,"Twenty million, thirty million—Forbes Magazine wasn’t counting the assets for some fat cat businessman. The magazine was counting up the take for a cool cat comedian—Eddie Murphy. He and Bill Cosby ended the 80’s earning more each year than almost any other entertainers. “Ol’ Cos,” like a veteran baseball pitcher, had spent decades achieving superstardom. Murphy, like a rookie “pheenom,” had seemingly come out of nowhere to conquer the comedy world while barely out of his teens.Eddie was born in Brooklyn. His parents divorced when he was three. For a time after his father’s death he and his brother Charles were placed in foster care. His mother remarried when Eddie was nine, and the family settled in Roosevelt, Long Island. Eddie went to Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School, and performed at the Roosevelt Youth Center talent shows in 1976. Admittedly growing up in an environment far removed from the racism and taunts that Richard Pryor knew as a child, Eddie’s idol was Elvis Presley whom he thought “had more presence and charisma than anybody who ever existed.” When he got into comedy, the young kid gravitated Richard Pryor albums loaded with all that cool cursing.On stage Murphy was Pryor without the hatred and bitterness. Murphy talked about sex like Richard, cursed like Richard, made faces like Richard. And when the cycle for angry young men ebbed and audiences wanted a smiling new face, Murphy took over for Richard. He rose quickly, performing at New York’s The Comic Strip for affluent East Siders who found his street jive an amusing novelty. Shortly after he was a regular on “Saturday Night Live” and soon the hit of the show. He began creating sketch characters. He fused Little Richard and Richard Simmons together for “Little Richard Simmons,” mimicked Stevie Wonder and Bill Cosby, and parodied Buckwheat of “Our Gang” and Gumby. Eddie didn’t ignore racial problems, but he presented them with surprisingly good humor in the ironic “Mr. Robinson’s Neighborhood” sketches and in his parodies of militant blacks like “Raheem Abdul Muhammad.”Raheem kidded both blacks and whites. The Murphy message was lighten up, or get down, depending on who was listening. Raheem railed against the encroachment of whites—in basketball. Complaining about teams with “token whites” on them, he shouted, “This is the most disgusting thing y’all have pulled up to date. I mean we ain’t got much, at least let us have basketball! Is nothing sacred? Any time we get something going good, y’all move in on it. In the 60’s we wore platform shoes. Then y’all wore platform shoes. Then in the early 70’s we braided our hair…y’all braided your hair. Now it’s 1980, we’re all on welfare, and by the end of next year y’all will be on welfare too. I don’t see no judge saying that every two bathroom attendants have to be white! All I’m saying is y’all stick to playing hockey and polo and we’ll stay in the courts. I mean, if God would have wanted whites to be equal to blacks, everyone would have one of these!”And with that, Eddie held up a giant radio.Murphy not only became a hot TV star, he became a super star on the concert circuit. With his open leather jackets, gold chains and entourage, and his sold out concerts in the largest venues around the country, he carried himself not as a mere comic but more a cross between a rock idol and the Heavyweight Champ of the world. Eddie left “Saturday Night Live” to become a box office champ in films, concert touring and record albums.Though his film “48 Hrs” was loaded with cliches and violence, it became a huge hit, and another mediocre concept, “Trading Places,” also bashed box office records. It was apparent Eddie Murphy could do no wrong. Monologues that seemed to be nothing but the mildly amusing anecdotes one might hear from any streetcorner wiseguy were being cheered by tens of thousands. The bigger Murphy got, the more incomprehensible his superstardom seemed to become. With the fad appeal came overkill. Murphy sensed it, sometimes upbraiding audiences for laughing when he hadn’t even said anything but a few curse words.Eddie signed a fifteen million dollar deal with Paramount and scored his biggest hit in the one film that captured all of his charisma, swagger and good humor, “Beverly Hills Cop.”The hysteria for Eddie Murphy intensified and the young star did his best to remain level-headed, vocal about his drug-free lifestyle. Still, the press, unable to gain access to the new superstar wrote with a certain hostility about his seeming arrogance, 3.5 million dollar home in New Jersey, hostile bodyguards and nubile girls all desperate to please the flaunting star/sex symbol. As with most comedians who earned fame through questionable material, the more it was questioned, the worse it became. At first Murphy cheerfully joked about Bill Cosby calling him up and telling him to clean up his four-letter act. Now, his stand-up show was intentionally dubbed “Raw” and the goofy put-downs of women, gays and Asians became more hostile.Murphy was not very concerned with white Middle America’s desire for him to continue with his “Saturday Night Live” characters or his light-hearted action films with white co-stars. He began making films geared more for black audiences and featuring black co-stars. He turned from comedy records to record R&B songs like “Put Your Mouth On Me” and “Love Moans” which were beyond the tastes of his white liberal supporters. Instead of being cheerfully “Delerious,” the title of his new concert film was “Raw,” and it was cautiously panned by white critics (was it cool to really attack a hip black comic who might just be too hip for them to appreciate?). Female critics were more hostile. So were some audience members: a man was killed in a drive-in shootout in California on opening night, and according to Variety “unruly” crowds proved disruptive at several other venues. Premiere magazine calculated that “Raw” averaged a profanity every 10 seconds, compared to 53 seconds for “Blazing Saddles” and one every three minutes 20 seconds for “Rocky.”Murphy’s first black-oriented films, “Coming to America” was viewed as benign, sophomoric (the requisite penis jokes) and middling. Then “Harlem Nights” was critically bombed. “There’s not an original idea in the movie,” said critic Roger Ebert, “and the modern four-letter dialogue is distracting in a period picture…” Partner Gene Siskel found it “shockingly embarrassing, with gross amounts of racist dialogue directed at both whites and blacks, a sexist portrayal of women…” Rolling Stone called the “rude, crude and misogynistic” film one of the worst movies of the year. Janet Maslin in The New York Times huffed Eddie “can continue to write his own ticket, since audiences will so eagerly pay to see him no matter what he happens to do.”As Murphy partied in chic nightclubs headlines followed, calling attention to alleged skirmishes with women, fans and photographers. An ex-manager sued him demanding money. Gay groups protested his concerts. The kid who once couldn’t do anything wrong was now the big star who couldn’t do anything right. Eddie asked for a little understanding. In 1988 he said, “All I want to say is that I’m just as screwed up as everybody else, no better, no worse, and I’m just as capable of sinning or of doing good as anybody else. I’ve done some real mean things and I’ve done some kind things, too…I’m an abstainer of drugs and alcohol, and although I have lavished money, cars, and a house, I’m still a manic depressive. I still go up and down. Everybody does…sometimes I’ll wake up and want to cry, and not really have any reason.”More scandals hit Murphy. He was accused of being selfish, taking eight million dollars for starring in “Coming to America” while histhree co-stars, Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones and John Amos shared one million. Then he was accused of being a plaigerist. Columnist Art Buchwald successfully sued Paramount claiming the film was based on material he had submitted earlier. Murphy himself was cleared, but the studio lost the case and had to pay up. He was even accused of turning his back on his own people when he announced that “Harlem Nights” would not be shot on location in Harlem.To restore his star lustre, Murphy found himself in a sequel, “Another 48 HRS,” which was greeted with mild approval and the hope for better work in the future. The fad for Murphy had risen and slumped at the start and end of the 80’s but into the 1990’s, Murphy remained a big box-office name in films and a powerful attraction whenever he chose to tour in stand-up comedy."
Ellen Degeneres,January,26,1958,Clean,28,53.9,2191,1876,"An unassuming young comic who suddenly became the center of controversy, Ellen Degeneres first earned fame for her quietly quirky stand-up routines.Her most famous line was a bit of witty whimsy about exercise and her grandmother: “My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was 60. She’s 97 today. We don’t know where the hell she is.”Audiences seemed to know who Ellen was: just another working comic, a slender, rather mousy girl in a mannish blouse and slacks who had a slightly tilted sense of humor and a nervously self-deprecating Bob Newhart-type delivery.When networks began to raid stand-up clubs in search of sitcom talent like Jerry Seinfeld and Paul Reiser, they decided that Ellen had that same kind of genial appeal. Ellen seemed alot like Jerry and Paul ? smart, genial, friendly and pleasant. They didn’t realize that like Jerry and Paul, she had an eye for the ladies.Obviously, the bio on Degeneris at the time was very simple. She’d made her debut in a local New Orleans coffee house in 1981 and spent nearly a decade polishing her disarming manner. She’d appeared in the brief run of the 1989 TV series “Open House” and the 1992 program “Laurie Hill.” Nothing suggested that there was any controversy in her life or any secrets in her closet.Ala Newhart, the network gave the lowkety comic a suitably modest setting (book store) and surrounded her with mildly odd friends and co-workers. The hope was for a decent, Newhart-type success, a Top 20 or Top 40 show.Indeed, Ellen’s winsome personality, and her habit of acting shyly confused and flustered (while uttering surprisingly sharp barbs) won her a good-sized following. She even hosted the Gramy Awards in 1996. She wrote a book, the title an example of her cute if windy style: “My point…and I do have one.”But the more popular she became, the more fans and reporters wanted to know about her. Soon the rumors of her lesbianism became a rising chorus: “When is Ellen and her TV character Ellen Morgan going to come completely out of the closet?”Some conservative TV stations and groups around the country were aghast. Still, Ellen decided to be true to herself and her comedy, and the nation watched the climactic episode when she comically revealed her love for another woman (via an inadvertent P.A. announcement at an airport).Not long after, Ellen announced her love for actress Anne Heche, a disasterous move professionally for both of them. Heche had been considered a sexy leading lady in movies—but not after it became known that she didn’t care about her leading man.The rising controversy coincided with the downward spiral of Ellen’s sitcom. The show had exhausted a lot of situations for comedy and after the famous “outing,” audiences grew tired of episodes that deliberatey played on the lesbian angle.Ellen’s own sense of humor about the lesbian controversy began to erode the more she had to defend herself. She was given to sarcastic jabs: “I was raised around heterosexuals, as all heterosexuals are, that’s where us gay people come from… you heterosexuals.”The fact was that Ellen’s comic persona had simply grown tiresome as well. 90’s audiences had become slick and hip, no longer finding a kindred spirit in the stuttery, awkward girl with the fake comic humility. The style of comedy had failed the most successful practicitioner at it; Bob Newhart. Newhart’s latest sitcom, “George and Leo,” had disappeared very quickly.Ellen’s sitcom ended, and she vowed to leave show business for a while and concentrate on her domestic life with Anne Heche."

Fahim Anwar,March,21,1985,Risqué,0,29.5,57,136,"The song of Afghan immigrants, Fahim Anwar received a degree in Mechanical Engineering at University of Washington and soon moved to Long Beach to work for Boeing. He would be designing airplanes as an aerospace engineer.But Anwar had a far different career already in mind - stand-up comedy. He was already four years in having begun performing at open mics at Seattle’s Comedy Underground when he was 18. The plan all along was to do the day job long enough until he was sure he had enough gigs to perform full time. The job in Long Beach would be perfect. He could drive to Los Angeles for stage time often.He lived a double life, no one at Boeing knowing of his comedy ambitions. After just three and a half years, he was able to transition to being a full time stand-up. He was one of the “New Faces” for the Montreal’s Just For Laughs Festival in 2010 as well as a finalist in NBC’s annual Stand-Up for Diversity Showcase.

Gabriel Iglesias,July,15,1976,Tame,34,48,1864,2022,"Gabriel “Picachu” Iglesias’ style of comedy is a mixture of story telling with characters and sound effects that bring all his personal issues to life. His amazing ability to cross over with a clean animated style of comedy has put him in big demand throughout the stand-up comedy circuit. Ask anyone who has seen him in concert and you will probably hear the same thing, “He was so funny!”Gabriel, one of the rising stars in the recent boom of Latino comedians, was put on the map by the Galavision TV show, “Que Locos!”. This highly successful television comedy hour quickly spawned into a nationwide tour of sold-out performances across the country. The experience not only helped to develop Gabriel’s loyal fan base, but also led to additional film and television roles. He has guest-starred on ABC’s “My Wife & Kids,” Showtime’s “Resurrection Boulevard” and was involved in the WB pilot for “Deez Nuts”. His stand-up has been featured on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,” “Good Morning America,” “Showtime at the Apollo” and BET’s “Comic View” to name a few. On the big screen, he has been seen in the independent film “El Matador,” and coming in 2005, Gabriel will star in “The Surfer King,” where he will play the role of Aokee, the manager of a water park Surf and Snack Shack.Known as the “fluffy” comic in the Hawaiian shirt, the 27-year old funny man often riffs about his girthy middle - whether it’s talking about how little dancing it takes for him to work up a sweat at the nightclub, or how hearing his girlfriend coo the words “chocolate cake” over the telephone works for him like phone sex.Gabriel performs stand-up nightly while spreading his positive message of laughter by day at high schools. He includes in his punch lines messages about the hazards of alcohol and the importance of voting. In 2000, Gabriel won a Kid’s Choice Award for the Nickelodean TV show “All That.” He then won the Comedy Central & Comcast Cable’s Comedy Special of the year in 2003 and in 2004 & 2005 was voted into the Top 25 of Comedy Central’s Standup Showdown.The youngest of six children, Gabriel spent his first five years living on the eastside of Chula Vista. By the age of eight Gabriel and his mother were on their own and making a fresh start in the city of Long Beach. One night Gabriel’s mother took him to the local video store where he rented a comedy tape starring Eddie Murphy. Two weeks later he was motivated to audition for his 5th grade talent show and to his suprise he was the hit of the show. Gabriel’s silly voices and characters left the audience in stitches and his dream of becoming a comedian was born. Eleven years later a friend of his pushed a very scared Gabriel Iglesias back onto a stage for the first time in over a decade. April 10th of 2005 will mark the eight-year anniversary of the day Gabriel made his dream of becoming a comedian a reality.“I get my material from things that happen every day,” he says, using his 10-year high school reunion as an example. “I had too much to drink and I made an ass of myself. When they asked ‘Who has been on TV?,’ one of the girls handed me a mic. I said, ‘I see three or four girls who turned me down in high school. But you know what? You girls got fat and now I drive a Hummer.’ One of the girls tells me, ‘You’re fat too!’ And I said, ‘I was always fat. I kept my figure, why couldn’t you?’ It was the conversation of the night. I don’t use writers. I use real life.”In his debut CD entitled, “Picachu… I See You,” Gabriel talks about hanging out with his buddies. He does not want to be labeled as a ‘Latino Comedian.’ “It’s just going to be funny. It won’t have an all-Latino audience. It’s going to be modern. I want to show people that Latinos are here, but we don’t have to be stereotypical.”"
George Carlin,May,12,1937,Dirty,160,80.3,3627,888,"Growing up in Manhattan, George Carlin was raised by his single parent - his mother. With his mother at work most of the day, Carlin spent a lot of time out on the streets, going where he wanted. He also spent a lot of time exploring his own creative impulses, his own mind. Both made him a loner - someone who felt outside of society.Through five decades in comedy, George Carlin did not vary his personal style. He remained a likable monologist able to balance a clowning, zany streak with the sharp-edged wit to dissect words and emotions with cutting irony. Yet through those five decades, Carlin changed emotionally and physically, reflecting the tumultuous shifts in culture and lifestyle from the 50’s to the 90’s.He offered engaging nightclub patter in the 50’s and early 60’s, cheerfully “hippy dippy” humor in the late 60’s, more crusading comedy in the 70’s, slightly mellowed humor in the early 80’s, and then more disillusioned, angry observations into the 90’s. Yet through it all, his style remained distinctly and identifiably his own.Each step of the way Carlin produced gems of monology. There were his early, solid and silly routines from “The Indian Sergeant” (“Cut out the horseplay. You guys playin’ with the horse—cut it out!”) to Al Sleet, the weatherman who announced: “Tonight’s forecast: dark!” These were followed by Lenny Brucian, banned-on-radio routines (“The Seven Words You Can’t Say On TV”) and gently philosophical and ironic observations (“A Place for My Stuff”). He was also known for comic querelousness, his Andy Rooney-styled questioning of words and phrases: “Undisputed heavyweight champion? Well, if it’s undisputed, what’s the fighting all about? Selling like hotcakes? Is this the biggest selling item?”Born in New York City, Carlin grew up the “class clown” After quitting high school and nearly getting tossed out of the Air Force, he became a disc jockey in Louisiana. At 20 he moved on to WEZE in Boston and met comedian Jack Burns. They formed a partnership and eventually came out to California where an impressed Lenny Bruce helped them find work. Some routines were standard (George as a punch-drunk boxer) but others dabbled in the new freedom of “sick” comedy (a TV commercial for the “Lolita Kit” that lets little girls “pick up a little cash after school…”)Carlin went solo in 1962 and soon became a TV regular, known for rubber faced comedy (his first album cover contained dozens of funny faces taken in a subway photo booth) and clean, inoffensive material. In the late 60’s, he and another “straight” comic, Richard Pryor, began to pursue comedy in the Lenny Bruce tradition. It began in 1970 when he was fired for using a four letter word in concert at The Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas. A short time later a few satiric comments on the Vietnam War caused a storm at the mainstream Playboy Club. Audience members were hostile and Carlin left; the club unable to guarantee his safety.Carlin was no longer willing to work in the restrictive casinos and nightclubs of the day. He found his audience at rock concerts. The change liberated his comedy and changed his delivery a bit. Since he had to work huge theaters opening for rock stars, he had to reach the crowd by using a lot of facial and physical cartooning. He noted, “You have to raise your voice above the din to be heard, to get their attention.” He also tended to “talk down” to the crowd and acted out phrases (“I sent awaaaaaay for it”). Critics sometimes insisted Carlin’s controversial routines (such as “The Seven Words You Can’t Say on TV”) were a lot milder and cuter than Lenny Bruce. That might have been true, but audiences got the message. So did the authorities who, in a supposedly more liberal age, tried to censor Carlin as they had Bruce.In 1972 Carlin was arrested in Milwaulkee at an outdoor concert. The police worried that some children might be hearing his comedy. The disorderly conduct charge was later thrown out. When a radio station played a Carlin routine, announcing beforehand that the routine might be objectionable to some people, the FCC fined them. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court and the radio station lost. Carlin continued to perform his “counter-cultural” routines and in the early 70’s was supported by enthusiastic fans who bought millions of them (his “AM & FM” and “Class Clown” discs were certified gold in 1973 and “Occupation Foole” went gold in 1976).Carlin was a tireless stand-up performer through the 70’s. In the mid 80’s some of the wear and tear began to show. Ironically he and Richard Pryor had similar problems: cocaine abuse and a heart attack. While Pryor made fun of it all on stage, Carlin kept the experience private. He told Ron Smith in 1989, “I feel vaguely embarrassed and presumptuous to present my life and my story as the subject for an evening’s entertainment. My imagination is aroused more by the things that are out there in the world that all of us deal with…language has always been a favorite subject for me… I don’t find my own story important.”For a time his stand-up turned more aggressive and bitter, with growling routines about the mindless violence of football and even some rare ringsider abuse (“You’re wearing an earring, sir? How about a kotex? Are you wearing one of them, too?”) What seemed to be eating at him was an unfullfilled desire: “I always wanted to be a movie actor like Danny Kaye. My plan was to become a radio disc jockey first, and then go into nightclubs as a comedian. My theory was, if I was a good enough comedian, they’d have to let me in the movies the way they let him in.”Carlin was able to land his first important role in a movie, a burned-out hippie in “Outrageous Fortune.” He later starred in the hit “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure.” Whether he made films or maintained his heavy schedule in stand-up, he had enthusiastic audiences waiting. Rather modestly, he simply characterized himself as “just someone who is open to things that surprise and delight and make you wonder; things that are ironic or absurd. I like contemplating silliness.”Though still young, in 1990 Carlin was perceived as “The Grand Old Man of Counterculture” in a New York Times review. TV interviewer Bob Costas asked him, “Do you think you’re as funny now as you were in the 70’s and 60’s?” He answered, “I’m doing my best work. I’m the only one that can ever really be the judge because I do it for myself. The fact that the audience is there is wonderful, but I do it for me. And I’m thinking better than I ever have, my observations I think stand out in better…I’m having more fun with it than I ever have, I know that.”"

Hannibal Buress,February,4,1983,Risqué,19,54.4,994,832,"Chicago native Hannibal Buress was named after the Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca. After attending a stand-up performance at his college, Southern Illinois University. Despite not being a devotee to stand-up, Buress thought he could do better than — or at least as bad as — what he saw. After starting his career downstate, Buress dropped out of college and began performing stand-up in Chicago in 2003. Along with comedy shows, Buress would frequent more music-oriented open mics, challenging himself to win over the audience.Hannibal worst stand-up gig came in his first year of performing. He appeared at a talent show which modelled itself after the famous Apollo theater of Harlem, where performers can get swept from the stage at the request of a rowdy crowd. Hannibal ended up getting physical carried off by the Sandman that evening.Buress’s has a very laid-back delivery, his absurdists observations coming at a slower roll than many high energy comics. Buress himself has describe his jokes as cutesy, meaning the material is more fun than biting. Buress suggest that he may evolve to a more personal and perhaps angrier point of view of his subsequent specials.Buress was featured in “The Awkward Comedy Show” special, along with the African-American comics Baron Vaughn, Eric André, Marina Franklin, and Victor Varnado.In 2008, Buress moved to New York. On his first evening in the city, he played two open mike and handed out flyers to get on a third. Only after the third show did he go with his bags to his new apartment.Buress’ comedic prowess has led to several writing gigs. His first appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon led to a job as a staff writer on Saturday Night Live during its 2009-2010 season. Buress was funny in the room, but with no sketch writing experience only one of his own ever made it to air. One of the hosts of SNL that season was Tina Fey, who liked him and hired him as a writer for her sitcom 30 Rock. He’s also acted on the show, as a recurring character of a homeless man.His first stand-up comedy album “My Name is Hannibal” was taped at the now defunct Lakeshore Theater in Chicago. The album was released on July 27, 2010 by Stand Up! Records. That same month, Hannibal made Variety’s “Ten Comic to Watch” list for 2010.In an interview with Esquire in early 2011, Chris Rock stated that Buress was the next big stand-up, describing him as “The illegitimate son of Mitch Hedberg.”Along with touring nationally, Buress hosts a free weekly stand-up comedy show at Brooklyn’s The Knitting Factory on the Sunday nights he’s in New York."
Hasan Minhaj,September,23,1985,Tame,3,31.7,121,261,"Outspoken, left-leaning political comedian Hasan Minhaj was born on September 23, 1985 in Davis, California to Muslim parents hailing from Aligarh, India. Much of his comedy and politics stem from his experience growing up as an Indian-American outsider in the supposedly progressive Bay Area. It didn’t help that for the first eight years of his life Minhaj could only confide in his strict, overwhelmed father while his mother studied medicine in India.Minaj studied political science at University of California, Davis and would regularly travel to San Francisco to perform. After winning a San Francisco radio comedy competition, he began working as an opening act for big name comedians like Katt Williams, Pablo Francisco, and Gabriel Iglesias.In 2009, Minaj moved to Los Angeles where he hosted several programs, including the Bill and Melinda Gates funded documentary “Stand Up Planet,” MTV’s Failosophy, and his own web series The Truth with Hasan Minaj. During this time, he also guest starred in the fourth season of Arrested Development and HBO’s Getting On.On November 19, 2014, Minhaj gained national attention when he became one of the final correspondents to be hired on The Daily Show before Jon Stewart’s departure. He would regularly be featured as the ‘Brown Person’ or ‘Muslim’ correspondent and mock the fact that he was expected to speak for billions of people worldwide.His success on The Daily Show led him to be chosen for the 2017 White House Correspondents Dinner. At the dinner, Hasan bashed the absent President Trump for not being able to take a joke in person and made a passionate plea for stronger gun control and a more probing free press. His new stand up special, “Homecoming King,” which is based on his 2015 off-Broadway theater show of the same name, is available on Netflix. He currently lives in New York with his wife Beena Minaj.Bio by Andy Gause"

Jeff Foxworthy,September,6,1958,Clean,17,50.3,1959,1933,"Georgia’s Jeff Foxworthy offered a slightly more witty version of Southern humor than some of the stars he grew up enjoying. Adapting a bit of Johnny Carson’s style of “formula” gag-writing, Foxworthy hit on a ceaseless array of jokes keyed to the phrase “You might be a redneck if…” As in:“You might be a redneck if you’ve ever cut your grass and found a car…if your Dad walks you to school because you’re in the same grade…if you’ve ever been too drunk to fish…”Foxworthy had dozens of ‘em, and they filled several novelty books as well as cassette tapes that he sold at his shows. He worked hard and long, quitting his $30,000 day job in the 80’s in order to earn a mere $20 a night in tough Atlanta comedy clubs.In 1990 Jeff won a “Best Stand-Up Comic” honor at the American Comedy Awards, quite an achievement, especially for a Southern comedian trading on “good ol’ boy” humor. Of course, unlike past practitioners such as Jerry Clower or the stars of Hee Haw, the lanky Foxworthy was not about to take to the stage in overalls or Grand Ol’ Opry finery. He told his jokes with a pleasant hint of a drawl and was able to find some crossover appeal when he appeared on “The Tonight Show.” He was just as likely to open for Jay Leno or Wynton Marsalis as country singers Garth Brooks and Eddie Rabbitt. He went on to star in two Showtime comedy specials.His solid comedy writing helped his first album, “You Might be a Rednick If…” hit triple platinum, an astonishing feat for any record, but especially a comedy album. He remained a consistent seller. His first three albums for Warners sold a combined total of eight million copies. His 1995 release, “Games Rednecks Play,” took only five weeks to reach the platinum level (it went on to double platinum). It was nominated for a 1996 Grammy and by that time Jeff had been rewarded with his own sitcom.Foxworthy’s TV series didn’t last long and critics found him to be rather bland. Even in his stand-up it was felt that his most distinctive trait was his joke writing rather than his joke telling. While his TV career stalled and he never went on to movies, Foxworthy has remained a top star on the stand-up circuit and his books and albums continue to do well. Foxworthy’s perhaps the best-sellign Southern humorist of the past 50 years. His “You Might Be A Rednick If…” novelty book eased through over 30 printins and his 1996 tome, “No Shirt No Shoes, No Problem” was on the New York Times Best Seller List for two months. Over 600,000 copies of it were sold—adding to the staggering 3 million copies of his previous books and over a million copies of his annual comedy calendar.Jeff’s branched out in other areas. He opened “Jeff Foxworthy’s Backyard Bar-B-Q” in Kissimee, Florida. He is the Honorary Chairman of the Duke University Children’s Hospital’s “Children’s Classic Golf Tournament.” He raised a million dollars for the hospital. Never forgetting his roots, Foxworthy still lives in his home town of Atlanta with his wife and two daughters."

Jerry Seinfeld,April,29,1954,Clean,61,71.5,3095,1231,"Through the late 1980’s Jerry Seinfeld quietly became one of the most dependable of the new “suit and tie” young comics, a group that included David Brenner, Jay Leno and Garry Shandling. Thin, pleasant, slightly wall-eyed, the clean-cut Seinfeld favored family-oriented observational comedy. On Halloween: “You’re 7 years old and you’re working for candy!” On retirement: “My parents moved to Florida last year. They didn’t want to, but they’re 60, and that’s the law.” On lunch: “What animal is luncheon meat? It all happened so fast. We were in the woods. Joe and I caught it, it was wiggling .All we know is that it’s some kind of meat and you should eat it around noon!” One of his best known bits was about losing a sock in the dryer. He theorized that the sock wasn’t lost, but had escaped. He imagined it pressed up flat against the dryer drum and then sneaking away. The hipper young comics scoffed at all this, but Seinfeld had a big general audience laughing—and he was going to the bank.“It’s not that I’m a prude,” said Jerry. “I’m a purist. I want to find true quality humor, that’s the quest, not to just get laughs…I just think my material should be funny on its own and not rely on the gratuitous laughs profanity gets.”Born in Brooklyn, raised in Massapequa, Long Island (“an Indian name which means ‘by the mall”) Jerry recalled he wasn’t the class clown. Everybody was: “Everybody in school was always fooling around. After we graduated, they went off and got jobs. I kept fooling around.” He graduated from Queens College and in the late 70’s began performing in comedy clubs. While many contemporaries iwent “full tilt bozo” in free-form comedy, or challenged the censors with x-rated material, Seinfeld, growing up watching smooth family-oriented comics like Alan King and Jan Murray, realized the satisfaction, and big money, in playing resorts, casinos and the top nightclubs.By 1981 he was appearing on “The Tonight Show” and later opening for Kenny Rogers, Andy Williams and Dionne Warwick. In 1987 he had his first HBO solo special. More talk show appearances followed, as well as a heavy touring schedule. In 1990 he hosted a comedy special on NBC and was rewarded with a critically praised sitcom as himself—a somewhat conservative looking single guy, middle-class but hip and humorous, trying to get along with dates, friends and family. As John J. O’Connor in The New York Times put it, “Mr. Seinfeld is definitely a nerd, a pleasant, good-looking young fellow who gives the impression that he might have a decent career as a stockbroker except for a compulsion to tell jokes.”He remained “family entertainment,” offering up little moments of everyday truth: “You go to the store and buy Grape Nuts. No grapes, no nuts. What’s the story?” He continued asking his audience vital questions: “Has any turtle ever outlived a shaker of turtle food?” It was all inoffensive, but Seinfeld would not have been surprised to find someone objecting. After all, he once said, “Nothing in life is fun for the whole family.”"
Jim Gaffigan,July,4,1966,Tame,108,72.8,3126,1167,"Jim Gaffigan grew up in Chesterson, Indiana. While growing up, New York City caught the imagination of the young Gaffigan, laying the seeds for his move later in life.His family life, particularly his bank manager father, encouraged him to pursue career stability. With that in mind, Gaffigan majored in finance in Georgetown. Despite committing his education to a more regular job, Gaffigan still harbored a hope of becoming an actor one day.He soon moved to New York, he joined an ad agency, at first working as an account executive, and then later as a copywriter. Gaffigan began exploring acting, taking classes at night, particularly improv classes. On a dare, Gaffigan tried stand-up. Gaffigan found he enjoyed it, particularly appreciating that, unlike acting, you didn’t have to wait for someone to cast you or give you a job. Gaffigan says that his first three performances went well and then he bombed for two years.When Gaffigan began performing stand-up as the scene was contracting after the boom years of the 1980s. The 1990s were a lean time for stand-up. Comedy clubs were closing so there were fewer places to perform stand-up. Gaffigan would find himself performing wherever he could, like the back of a Hamburger restaurant.For a long time, Gaffigan struggled, watching fellow comic friends of his getting late night spots. He jokes that at this time of his life his best credit was that fellow comic Dave Attell thought he was funny.Finally in 1999, he made his first appearance on CBS’s Late Show and impressed host David Letterman that he asked Gaffigan to develop a sitcom for Letterman’s production company World Wide Pants. The result was the short-lived “Welcome to New York” featuring Gaffigan as a weatherman.The bump also affected his stand-up career. Comedy Central, which previously would not have him on Premium Blend, asked him to tape a half-hour Comedy Central Presents special. The special was popular, getting high ratings and often getting voted to be a part of Comedy Central’s yearly Stand-Up Showdown.In 2002, Gaffigan removed any swear words from his act, considering them an easy way to get a laugh but not necessarily for anything funny. He considers the typical targets for his humor- things like bacon and bathrobes - do not require that he curses.Gaffigan shot his first one-hour special entitled “Beyond the Pale” at Chicago’s Vic Theater. Release in 2005, the “Beyond the Pale” DVD went gold within six months and a CD of the same title followed soon after. A special feature on the DVD is Jim Gaffigan’s first performance ever.In December of 2007, Jim Gaffigan recorded his second Comedy Central special at Austin’s Paramount Theater. The title and airdate are, as of this writing, unknown.Gaffigan is a respected performer in both the mainstream and alternative scenes, equally welcome at both a comedy nightclub stage or a small black box theater.One hallmark of his act is the whispery voice he gives imaginary audience members, commenting on his own act, often making fun of the material he just delivered. Among some of his more famous routines are his riffs on manatees and the disgustingness of the food Hot Pockets.After a performance, Gaffigan often plants himself in the lobby to meet his fans and sign CDs and DVDs for them, often staying until every one who wanted to meet him has. He says it’s a simple way to show his gratitude to the people are paying to see him, particularly after the years of performing for tiny audiences. Gaffigan has been a frequent performer on both the Late Show with David Letterman and on Late Night with Conan O’Brien. Gaffigan voices the characters of Pale Force, which features animated versions of himself and Conan O’Brien. The cartoon revolves a pasty superhero duo whose powers are extremely white skin that’s blinding to their enemies. Gaffigan also co-writes all the episodes. The series runs on the web and also appears during Gaffigan’s appearances on the late night program.In 2013, Gaffigan released his first book entitled “Dad is Fat.” The book debuted at #5 on the New York Times best seller list.Gaffigan lives in New York with his wife and five children."

Jim Norton,July,19,1968,Dirty,47,62.5,2471,1486,"Jim Norton grew up in suburban New Jersey. Norton claims to have known he wanted to be a comic since he was 12, when he idolized Richard Pryor.His mother was a librarian and his father a postal worker for the military. Norton describes his childhood as relatively positive, but eventually low self-esteem led him to begin drinking alcohol to excess at an early age. At age 18, Jim Norton attempted suicide by slitting his wrist. He describes the attempt as more attention-getting than serious. Subsequently, he went to rehab for alcohol abuse. He completed the program and has maintained his sobriety until today.After rehab, Norton completed his GED as he had missed his high school graduation. While living with his parents, he got a job in a warehouse working a forklift.In 1989, Norton started to pursue stand-up comedy, attending an open mics. His first was at central Jersey’s Varsity Pub, which would become a frequent haunt. Norton was afraid of performing and would often wish that shows would be cancelled so he wouldn’t have to go on stage.Jim Florentine, another comic of the “cringe” school, got Norton his first paying gig as a stand-up. The comics became fast friends and later, roommates. Occasionally they collaborate today, recently for the web portal Super Deluxe with the series “Good Side Of Bad News.”While performing in Los Angeles, Norton met Andrew Dice Clay. Clay took a shine to the younger Norton and ask him to fill in when Clay’s opening act dropped out at the last minute. Norton began to tour with Clay regularly.A trait of Norton’s comedy is an unflinching honesty about his sexual behavior. Norton admits to having sex with escorts frequently - occasionally even suggesting that he’s paid girls to use him as a toilet. Norton currently is in a relationship and has said he does not frequent prostitutes any more.Jim Norton was a frequent guest on Tough Crowd, a late night roundtable show with Colin Qunn as host and moderator. Norton was well suited the format, where comics such as Patrice O’Neal and Nick Di Paolo would crack on each other as they discussed the issues of the day.During the second season of the NBC reality show Last Comic Standing, Jim Norton reached the semi-finals. He ultimately had to drop out of the contest due to a prior commitment to MTV.Jim Norton is a fixture on the Opie and Anthony Show, often appearing on the show three or four times a week when he’s not on the road performing stand-up comedy. Norton credits a good deal of his success to the radio hosts and has pointed them out in the crowd during both of his HBO specials. In 2006, he helped coordinate the “Opie and Anthony’s Traveling Virus Comedy Tour” bringing together comics such as Bill Burr, Rich Vos and Bob Saget. Norton headlined several of the dates.In 2007, Norton published his first book entitled “Happy Endings: The Tales of a Meaty-Breasted Zilch.” The book rose to #4 of the New York Times Non-Fiction Bestseller List, above former Vice President Al Gore’s book, much to Jim Norton’s amusement. The foreword was written by fellow comic Colin Quinn.Later that year, Norton created his first one-hour special for HBO entitled “Monster Rain.” The title for the special comes from a game he would play as a pre-pubescent boy with his friend where they would yell “Monster Rain” and then hide under a porch and trade blowjobs with each other. He taped the special at The Lincoln Theatre in Washington, DC."

Joe Mande,March,16,1983,Tame,1,42.7,143,192,
Joe Rogan,August,11,1967,Dirty,50,55.5,2237,1791,"Though born in the tri-state area (specifically New Jersey), Joe Rogan was raised in Massachusetts - making many of his early comedy influences from Boston. His earlier passion however was the martial arts, which he discovered as an early teen. Rogan credits the martial arts with granting him the discipline to keep himself out of trouble, something that was common before he had become a practitioner.Rogan had earned a black belt in Tae Kwon Do by the time he was 15. He was skilled enough to win four consecutive Massachusetts Full Contact Tae Kwon Do Championship followed by a wining the Grand Championship at the US Open Tae Kwon Do Meet.Many of Joe’s friends in the martial arts encouraged him to perform stand-up. Rogan relented for a long time, believing that they only laughed because they knew him, doubting that he could get strangers to laugh. Finally at his friends’ insistence, Rogan took the stage at an open mike at Boston’s Stitches. Rogan describes the experience as a revelation. From that point in time he knew that stand-up was his true life’s purpose. He soon left the martial arts to devote himself to stand-up full time.Rogan at first found it difficult to get work, as his act was not what many middle-of-the-road clubs wanted. He went through several odd jobs to support his new art - chauffeur, construction worker and, for time, as an employee for a detective agency. The rawness of his style did get him a gig at seedier venues and events - strip clubs and bachelor parties.After cajoling a club owner to let him on stage (for no money), he was seen by comedy manager Jeff Sussman. Sussman was impressed and asked Rogan to consider moving to New York. Rogan jumped and Sussman soon had Rogan his first TV gig: MTV Half Hour Comedy Hour.Things worked fast from there - he was cast in a series called Hardball, that failed relatively quickly. But soon after he was introduced to America as the character “Joe Garelli” in the NBC sitcom Newsradio (a part where he replaced Ray Romano).Rogan continued to perform stand-up during that time, though many didn’t realize it was his main talent because they knew him as an actor first. (Rogan, in fact, had never acted before moving to Los Angeles) Rogan required clubs to put a sign up warning the audience of the language and content of the shows, so that people thinking they’d see “Joe Garelli” would realize they’d be seeing something quite different.During NewsRadio’s fifth and final year, Paul Simms, the show’s creator, attempted to sell a sitcom with Rogan as the central character. NBC passed on the show, which would have been titled Overseas.Rogan soon became well known for a reality show entitled Fear Factor, where people were challenged to perform stunt of an extreme nature including at times eating unappetizing animal parts. While the show was lucrative for Rogan, it did not offer him many chances to be funny. Know it gave him name recognition, it was not necessarily as a comic.In 2000, Joe Rogan released his first CD called I’m Gonna Be Dead Someday on the Warner Brothers label. Rogan pieced the CD from shows recorded in two towns - his hometown of Boston and in Houston, what he considers the birthplace of the kind of comedy he performs. Houston’s Laff Stop was a frequent haunt for both Bill Hicks and Sam Kinison.  In early 2007, Rogan confronted Carlos Mencia on stage, accusing him of being a frequent joke thief (Rogan’s nickname for Mencia is “Menstealia”). The confrontation was recorded by Rogan’s website crew, who edited into the video with their evidence of Mencia’s stealing. They then uploaded it the web and virally promoted it to many social media sites. The subsequent uproar cost Rogan his management and his relationship with The Comedy Store, the comedy club where the fight took place. Rogan however has largely been lauded both within comedy circles and the general public for the dust-up, making many aware of his considerable comedy chops. For his part, Rogan has no regrets about the affair.Rogan has also been outspoken about the accusations that Dane Cook stole from Louis CK.Rogan’s second CD followed soon after. Entitled Shiny Happy Jihad, it was released on the Comedy Central Records label. The later part of the CD features Rogan taking questions from the crowd and riffing routines from them.Rogan’s material is often philosophical, delving into the limits of human knowledge and the rareness we notice those limits. A particularly famous bit has him asking the audience if they believe they could reassemble technological society from the people in the club if the rest of the world died out. Rogan delivers many of his jokes in what appears to be an adrenaline fervor, a sort of testosterone rant. The tension between his insight and his style makes many of his routines powerful.June of 2009 brought “Talking Monkey in Space”, a new one-hour special from Rogan that aired on the male-oriented cable network Spike TV, a first for the channel. Spike often has Rogan as a color commentator for Ultimate Fighting Championship bouts. Rogan filmed the special at Columbus, Ohio’s Southern Theatre.

John Mulaney,?,NA,1982,Tame,28,51.3,1558,1482,"John Mulaney claims to have made an early start in performing comedy, joining a Chicago sketch group called “Rugrats” (no relation to the Nickelodeon show) when he was 7.From there, Mulaney grew up with his feet in both the past and the present in comedy, being both a devotee of “The Simpsons” along with listening to old tapes of radio shows from Jack Benny and the duo Bob & Ray.

Improv.The young comic soon moved to New York to take part of the downtown open mike scene, getting up on stage as much as possible in his first year in the city.For part of his young life, Mulaney was an alcoholic. Though he’s given up drinking, Mulaney sometimes talks about his “drunkard” experiences on stage, but on occasion audiences are a little uncertain about how to take them, assuming that the clean cut appearing comic is putting them on.Comedy Central embraced Mulaney early, putting him on the first season of their rising comic showcase “Live at Gotham,” appearing in an episode hosted by Patton Oswalt. In 2009, Comedy Central Records released his first album “The Top Part” and soon afterwards also broadcasted his first solo half-hour special, “Comedy Central Presents John Mulaney.”Besides performing at clubs and college across the country, John Mulaney has taken part of several comedy tour including the Comedians of Comedy Tour and opening for Mike Birbiglia during his Secret Public Journal Live Tour.

He was raised in Dayton, and when he left home, he voyaged from place to place in order to make a living for himself. Because he was such an intelligent child, he became very inventive in his methods to support himself.

Needless to say, this was extremely difficult for a single parent. He has since adopted children, which has also been a source of tireless motivation. Katt Williams began to perform in “White rooms” all across the country. Although his reputation grew, he had not yet achieved his goals in the comedy realm. In 1999, Katt moved to Los Angeles, California, and within a year and a half, became a respected presence in the local comedy clubs.

Lenny Bruce,October,13,1925,Dirty,22,62.4,2513,1515,"In 1960, as Lenny Bruce’s controversial stand-up career was on the upswing, Walter Winchell called him “America’s #1 Vomic.”In 1966, as Lenny Bruce’s controversial stand-up career was sputtering downward, Dick Gregory declared “Lenny Bruce, two thousand years from now will be one of the names that will still be remembered. He’s to show business what Einstein was to science.”Twenty years later Dick Cavett said, “He was a dazzling performer at his best, and I don’t know why that isn’t enough for people.”Even after so many decades, after 800 pages of a biography, and after dozens of posthumous audio and video releases, Lenny Bruce remains the most controversial figure in the history of comedy. Not only do some have moral quarrels with his lifestyle (as earlier generations did with Chaplin and Arbuckle), and not only is there mystery surrounding his death (as there is with comedienne Thelma Todd), there is still debate over the simplest premise for any stand-up performer: whether he’s funny or not.Born on Long Island, his parents divorced, Lenny grew up neurotic, hungry for affection, bewildered by the rules and regulations of the adult world and the confusion of two separate worlds—his father’s and his mother’s. He leaned toward his mother’s world. She was Sally Marr, a sometime stand-up comic and entertainer who sometimes took him to burlesque shows. She brought him to “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts” on April 18, 1949. Lenny tied for first place and began a grinding career doing straight schtick, impressions and mc work in strip clubs. He married a stripper, Honey Harlowe, who had worked as Honey Michel.Bruce raised money any way he could, and once was arrested for impersonating a priest soliciting funds for a leper colony. Around 1953 he worked briefly as a screenwriter. He managed to star in “Dance Hall Racket,” a stilted low-budget exercise redeemed only slightly by his lively imitation of a murderous small-time hood. Honey had a bit part as a gun moll. Their daughter Kitty was born in 1955, but within a few years, the family was shattered by divorce and drug abuse.Lenny’s comedy was changing, turning hipper and “sicker.” He fused old-fashioned gags with a new-found irreverence: “My mother-in-law broke up my marriage. My wife came home and found us in bed together.” The more critics objected, the wilder Lenny got. A favorite early (1959) routine was an airline bit on John Graham, the man who blew up a plane with forty people and his mother aboard for the insurance money. Lenny summed it up: “For this the state sent him to the gas chamber, proving actually that the Amerian people are losing their sense of humor…”Lenny then went on to prove his own sense of humor and his innate ability to satirize human nature as he recreated the scene—the pathetic con-man Graham handing her the gift box and impatiently shouting “fill out the policy!” and the naive mother who believes her son can do no wrong (“it’s a music box!” “yeah, you’ll get a bang out of it”). He moves on chronicle the pesty passengers who elicit laughter from the audience and no sympathy. After the explosion the pilot is concerned only about his job (“are we gonna get yelled at!”) while the stewardess whines that the surviving passengers are becoming “cranky.”While some of the humor was in the sick concept, much of it was in Lenny’s charismatic ability to create vivid, satirically etched characters. Everybody aboard the plane came to life, every homely detail intact. He didn’t spare himself, either. In the bit on airlines, Lenny sketched in a portrait of himself—alone, making faces at himself in the airplane bathroom. It was part of Bruce’s nature to bare himself to his audience. While Mort Sahl pioneered many of the techniques Lenny adopted, Mort’s attitude was more like a therapist talking to a patient, or the patient on the couch. Lenny was in the confessional, sometimes as priest, sometimes as penitent.Bruce’s most memorable routines had both aggressive moments and vulnerable moments. In “To Come,” he shocked the 50’s audience by declaring “To is a preposition, come is a verb.” But in the course of his fierce routine (accompanied by drums) he talked about impotence and love (“I can’t come” “‘Cause you don’t love me, that’s why you can’t come.” “I love you. I just can’t come. That’s my hangup…”) In another routine, he challenges the audience: “Would You Sell Out Your Country?” Then he adds, “I don’t have to think twice. I know me, Jim. The flag goes right down the toilet.” And he describes a torture scene, a patriot who won’t spill his country’s secrets—until he discovers he’s about to be given a hot lead enema.Sometimes Bruce used more poignant observation than harsh satire, as in his portrait of homely home folks in Lima, Ohio: “they show me how the house used to look…how dirty the other people were who lived there…we cleaned for months…yeah, that’s a very lovely closet. It’s nice the way the towels are folded…they always have a piano nobody plays. The function of the piano is to have that brown 8x10 picture of that shlub in the army saluting…”One of the reasons Lenny Bruce was so important to comedy was the complexity of his work. Something as simple as a parody of “The Lone Ranger” had shock comedy (“masked man’s a fag! bet you got mascara under that mask!”), satire (“I like what they do to fags in this country—they throw them in jail with a lot of men, very clever!”) and vulnerability (as the hero admits “I must have a ‘thank you, masked man…’).Audiences encouraged Lenny toward more “free-form” comedy. He wanted to do less set “bits” and one-liners and more observational material drawn, like a jazz musician, from his feelings and emotions of the moment. When some of his sexual or religious material received negative criticism, it only goaded him into more furious assaults. He took on any topic that he felt discomfort in talking about, whether it was how to remove snot from suede or whether Jacqueline Kennedy was “going for help” or running for cover when the shots were fired in Dallas, a difference between supposed heroism and forgivable human nature.Bruce didn’t have all the answers. He questioned his own business—where an entertainer could earn $50,000 a week while a school teacher made next to nothing.Anti-Bruce forces were powerful. While there wasn’t much that could be done to silence him for religious or political material, when it came to “dirty words,” the law was clearly on their side. “What’s wrong with appealing to prurient interests?” Lenny wanted to know. He wondered why Las Vegas was the entertainment capitol of the country when the big attraction was “tits and ass.” His use of those terms was shocking at the time—ironic considering that his use popularized the term and it’s slang abbreviation “T & A.”He joked, “if anyone believes that God made his body, and that body is dirty, the fault lies with the manufacturer.” But it was no joke to those who were offended by Lenny Bruce. Lenny was busted for obscenity several times—and in his struggle to not only free himself, but change the attitudes and laws on obscenity—he found himself in legal quicksand, his money and strength draining away. Lenny had his weaknesses to begin with and drugs were part of that. The narcotics busts that always seemed to occur around the same time as the obscenity arrests exacerbating Bruce’s problems and his increasing paranoia.Bruce struggled on, his stage act becoming increasingly obsessed with dissecting law and language, trying to make sense of the nonsense. Variety reported that he made $108,000 in 1960 and just $6,000 in 1964. He was bankrupt in 1965 and dead in 1966. In his last days he had experimented with LSD taken sleeping pills, and worried his friends with his heroin abuse. Nobody was in the house when Lenny died. He had been typing—the electric typewriter was on, and he had been in mid-sentence: “Conspiracy to interfere with the fourth amendment const.”He was found by his friends, in the bathroom, a needle in his arm. It seemed strange. Lenny would not have simply thrown a sash around his arm and jabbed the needle in. None of the paraphernalia he used to shoot up, including a spoon and matches, were around. When the police arrived, they arranged the body for some photographs and added a few touches—like a box of syringes found under the sink. There remain conflicts between the police reports and eyewitness testimony. Confusion over such basic facts as whether the drug was morphine or heroin, and whether the injection was administered by Lenny (accidentally or as a suicide attempt) or by someone else, have left the death of Lenny Bruce as controversial as his life.In 1971 the Broadway show “Lenny” sparked a Lenny Bruce revival, and in this radical half of the decade, students clamored for the re-issue of his albums, and previously unavailable works. Lenny was nominated for more Grammy awards posthumously than during his lifetime. The 1974 film version of “Lenny” brought even more attention to Bruce, along with Albert Goldman’s biography. In the passing years other comedians utilized elements of Lenny’s style and teachings, often with broader and more cartoonish strokes. Some young listeners complain they simply can’t “get” the original. They didn’t grow up going to Jewish candy stores and were too young to understand the guilt trips involved in growing up in the repressed 50’s.They never saw the films Lenny satirized and didn’t understand the jazz lingo or Yiddishisms strewn through his bits. They had no ear for routines without big payoffs, and were used to far “dirtier” material. They enjoyed George Carlin’s more accessible bits on dirty words and Richard Pryor’s version of the “I’m going to piss on you” bit.But for many, Lenny Bruce remains not only an original—but still funny, still provocative, and one of the few comedians whose “sound” is so charismatic it can be heard over and over for the sheer pleasure of his characterizations and word-weaving.There were songs written about Lenny Bruce as he rose to notoriety. Grace Slick and her band at the time, The Great Society, sang: “he’s our kind of preacher, ain’t none of us gonna put him down. He’s trying to say something to ya. Listen while you’re still around.”There were songs for Lenny Bruce when he died. Tim Hardin’s was a dirge: “I’ve lost a friend and I don’t know why…” Paul Simon collaged the news reports of his death with a chorus of “Silent Night.” And on another number he declared, “I learned the truth from Lenny Bruce!”There were songs for Lenny Bruce twenty years after his death. Bob Dylan sang: “...he was an outlaw, that’s for sure. More of an outlaw than you ever were. Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit’s livin’ on and on.”Songs are sung for those who are bigger than life and bigger than death. Legends. In his lifetime, he once said, “I’m not a comedian. I’m Lenny Bruce.” Now, no writer, no critic, no friend and no foe ever can write about him as just a comedian. Because he was Lenny Bruce."
Lewis Black,August,30,1948,Tame,92,70.1,2998,1277,"Lewis was born in Washington D.C. and raised in Silver Spring, MD. Colicky as a baby, it seems he was destined to be angry and easily irritated. His mother, a teacher, and his father, a mechanical engineer, instilled in both Lewis and his younger brother Ron the importance of education and the necessity to question authority; lessons which have influenced Lewis throughout his private and professional life. When Lewis was 12, his father took him to his first play and he quickly fell in love with the theatre. This ultimately led Lewis to pursue a career in drama. Degrees followed from the University of North Carolina and Yale Drama School, with a stint in Colorado owning a theatre with a group of friends in the interim. During his tenure at UNC, Lewis first ventured into stand-up, performing at Cat’s Cradle in Chapel Hill. Stand-up continued to be a steady presence as he pursued his career in theatre.Lewis eventually settled in New York City and became the playwright-in-residence at the West Bank Café’s Downstairs Theatre Bar. Lewis oversaw the development of more than 1,000 plays, including works by West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin, American Beauty writer Alan Ball as well as his own original works. In addition to overseeing the works on stage, Lewis emceed every show. As the West Bank grew, so did Lewis’ skill as a stand-up and eventually, the fulfillment of performing stand-up outweighed that of working in the theater. Having found his public voice, Lewis left the West Bank in the late 80’s to pursue stand-up full time.In 1996, his friend Lizz Winstead tapped him to create a weekly segment for a show she was producing on Comedy Central called The Daily Show. The segment, a three minute rant about whatever was bothering him at the moment, evolved into Back in Black. It became one of the most popular and longest running segments on the show and also created a long and successful relationship with the network. Since then, Lewis has taped four specials for the Comedy Central Presents series, co-created Last Laugh with Lewis Black, presides over Lewis’ Black’s the Root of All Evil, and continues to perform Back in Black on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. His popular appearances on Comedy Central helped to win him Best Male Stand-Up at the American Comedy Awards in 2001.Increased exposure from The Daily Show eventually generated a record deal with Stand Up! Records. His first CD, The White Album, was released in 2000 to much critical acclaim. Lewis followed with six more, four under the Comedy Central Records label. He received a 2006 Grammy nomination for Luther Burbank Performing Arts Center Blues and in 2007 won the Grammy for Best Comedy Album for The Carnegie Hall Performance.Having developed a strong relationship with HBO, he’s filmed two specials, Black On Broadway and Red, White and Screwed. The latter was nominated for an Emmy in 2007. He had a regular feature for two seasons on Inside the NFL and in 2006 was honored to be asked to participate in Comic Relief.A much sought after guest for several late-night television shows, he’s been seen on Larry King Live, is a frequent guest on Late Night with Conan O’Brian and has appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman. He’s had numerous, memorable appearances on CNN and is particularly happy to have contributed to MSNBC’s Countdown with Keith Olbermann.In the midst of a rigorous touring schedule, regular TV appearances and movie roles, Lewis has written two best selling books, Nothing’s Sacred (Simon and Schuster, 2005) and Me of Little Faith (Riverhead Books, 2008). Both garnered critical praise as well commercial success and spent numerous weeks on the New York Times best seller list.As a playwright Lewis has penned over 40 plays, many of which have been produced around the country. The Deal, a dark comedy about business, was made into a short film in 1998 and picked up by the Sundance Channel.

Marc Maron,September,27,1963,Dirty,28,52,1977,1826,"Growing up, Maron would often watch Don Rickles and Buddy Hackett or listen to records by George Carlin and Richard Pryor, sparking his first interest in the art of stand-up.Still it took a while to start performing. As a college freshman, Maron went to The Comic Strip in New York City to see a show and encountered Paul Reiser. He asked for advice about doing stand-up, and Reiser said, “You just gotta do it.”Post college, Maron returned home to New Mexico. But it was only a quick stop, as he soon jumped in his car to move to Los Angeles.

Maria Bamford,September,3,1970,Tame,73,53.7,2096,1810,"Born in California, Maria Bamford grew up in Duluth, Minnesota. While in high school, Bamford would run for student government offices, mostly to have an opportunity to deliver a funny speech to her classmates.Bamford spent two years of college at Bates in Maine, mostly because she was uncertain of what else to do with herself. She explored the school theater program but didn’t particularly enjoy it. For a year she studied English in Edinburgh where she discovered improv. She began to perform with Theater Sports. When she returned the states, Bamford finished her studies at the University of Minnesota. During her senior year she was treated for depression, but recovered thanks to medication. She still takes medication today.Maria began performing stand-up in Minneapolis at the age of 21, though she had considered attempting it earlier. But heckling was more common in the Northeast and in Scotland, so she decided to wait until returning to Minnesota to try the art. Within two years, she received her first paying gigs. She began to make a living from her comedy shortly before she turned 30. Until she could support herself with her stand-up however, she regularly performed temp jobs. Many of her experiences at those jobs became fodder for her act. When Maria began performing stand-up, she would often accompany it by playing the violin, using it to break up jokes. At the time, she rationalized that the audience would at least enjoy one part of the act.A trait of her stand-up is her ability to fall into distinct voices of characters, many of which are satirized for their somewhat conventional and myopic viewpoint on life. Her own natural voice is quite high, so the contrast of the more “adult” voices, along with the bite in their portrayal is often surprising and explosively funny.In the late 90s, Bamford moved to Hollywood to advance her career, capitalizing on the positive buzz from an appearance at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen.In 2003, Bamford hit the festival circuit hard performing at Montreal’s Just For Laughs Festival, The Edinburgh Fringe Festival, The Melbourne Comedy Festival, THe Murphy Cat Laughs Festival (Ireland) and The Brighton Comedy Festival.Bamford brought her one-woman show “Plan B” to Austrialia for a one month long run in 2005. The shows sold out and the success brought her to Edinburgh to stage the show. The material has subsequently been adapted to a web show for the burgeoning broadband comedy portal Super Deluxe.Bamford joined her friend Patton Oswalt for his project “The Comedians of Comedy”, a tour which brought comedy to alternative venues such as rock clubs. Bamford, Oswalt along with comics Brian Posehn and Zach Galifianakis have had various legs of the tour documented. A swing through the west coast was made for Netflix as a movie and a second tour, which focused on the northeast, was made into a six-part series for Comedy Central. Comedians of Comedy has continued past these filmed incarnations with Bamford as a regular feature.In 2006, Maria Bamford filmed her second Comedy Central Presents special, becoming the first female performer to achieve the distinction.Maria Bamford has performed stand-up on nearly all the late night talk show including “Late Night with Conan O’Brien”, “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno”, “The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”"

These personal, autobiographical diary entries, which evoke the nostalgic tone of David Sedaris and the relatability of Bill Cosby, have truly defined Birbiglia’s public persona.2007 saw the release of “My Secret Public Journal Live” on CD. The release gained much critical attention, named as Best Comedy Album of 07 by both Time Out NY and Time Out Chicago along with appearing on the year end best lists for The Boston Globe, Denver Post and Las Vegas Weekly.In early 2008, Mike Birbiglia made “Secret Public Journal” into a one-hour special entitled “Mike Birbiglia: What I Should Have Said Was Nothing.” The special premiered on Comedy Central. A longer 90 minute version was released on DVD April 8th, along with a tour documentary named, as somewhat of a warning, “Strictly for Fans.”In October of 2008, Birbiglia brought his one-man show “Sleepwalk with Me” off-Broadway to the Bleeker Street Theatre. During “Sleepwalk”, Birbiglia tells the story of he nearly died as a result of his sleep disorder and the life experiences that make his subconscious start roaming. The show was very successful, being held over several time before it finally closed in June of 2009.Later this year, Birbiglia will embark on a new stand-up tour entitled “I’m in the Future Also.” The title is based on a line he tells the audience when they have a “oh no” laugh/cringe reaction to a moment in one of his stories."
Mike Epps,November,18,1970,Tame,6,45.2,1663,2018,"Mike Epps was born in Indiana, switching his time between his grandparents in Gary and between his mother’s home in Indianapolis. His comic impulses were evident from an early age, but not always in positive ways. As a young teen, he spend four months in juvenile detention after super gluing a classmate’s hands together.While in his late teens, Epps entered a stand-up comedy contest at a local club. Though he did not win, the experience was enough to drive him to the art form. He soon moved to Atlanta, which had a burgeoning African-American circuit. He became a regular at the Comedy Act Theater.He was not there for long, soon striking off for New York at the urging of a club owner. He was only 21. By the time, Def Comedy Jam had ground into a phenomenon and it swept up Epps along with it. He appeared in two of the episodes of the groundbreaking series and later, toured as part of the Def Comedy Jam tour.An appearance at Los Angeles’ Comedy Store would inspire Ice Cube to cast Epps in “Next Friday.” Later Epps would star in “How High”, “All About the Benjamins”, “Resident Evil: Apocalypse” and the big screen version of “The Honeymooners” opposite Cedric the Entertainer. Throughout his movie career, Epps has prided himself in continuing to perform stand-up citing it as “therapy” to work out material in front of an audience.Epps has been tapped to star in a biopic chronicling the life of Richard Pryor. Epps met the legendary comic only a few months prior to his death. The status of the project, which was being planned by Pryor’s widow, is unknown. Epps claims to have not heard Pryor’s stand-up until he was 22 years old.In 2006, Epps hosted a new season of Def Comedy Jam for HBO. In the same year, shot a one-hour special entitled “Mike Epps: Inappropriate Behavior” for the network. He shot “Behavior” at the San Jose Improv,Epps has stated his favorite place to perform in New York City is Manhattan Proper, which only has comedy on Tuesday night.

Mitch Hedberg,February,24,1968,Tame,184,73.8,3276,1166,"Born and raised in the St. Paul area, Mitch Hedberg decided to start his own comedy career in South Florida. Not so much for the comedy scene, but for the sun. His landlord would drive him up and down the coast from club to club in his pick-up truck where Mitch would lie down in the back to avoid any of the negative conversations his landlord would try to have with him.Mitch developed his style in Florida and decided to try it out on different audiences. He moved to Seattle and toured throughout the Pacific Northwest honing his act in front of the new audiences. While in Los Angeles, Mitch booked his first television appearance on MTV’s “Comikaze” by walking into the MTV offices and personally pitching himself to the talent coordinator. Many cable shows followed including A&E’s “Comedy on the Road,” Comedy Central’s “Comedy Product,” and NBC’s “Comedy Showcase” hosted by Louie Anderson.In 1996, Mitch got his break with an invitation to perform at the prestigious Just for Laughs Montreal International Comedy Festival. His performances secured him a deal with a studio and a spot on “The Late Show with David Letterman.” Letterman enjoyed the set so much that he actually quoted one of Mitch’s bits later in the show.Mitch’s stand-out performances on the Letterman show (on which he appeared 10 times) and at comedy festivals secured a development deal with FOX to create his own sitcom and prompted TIME magazine to proclaim him “the next Seinfeld” and The Hollywood Reporter to headline their review of the Festival, “Laughs are Loudest for Hedberg.”Mitch also released two popular comedy CDs, “Strategic Grill Locations” and “Mitch All Together,” and he wrote and directed a film, “Las Enchiladas!” which had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.Known for his dry, observational wit and low-key style, Mitch Hedberg was a master of turning everyday details into brilliant one-liners:“I got my hair highlighted, because I felt some strands were more important than others.”“I wish I could play little league now. I’d be way better than before.”“I think pickles are cucumbers that sold out.”“A severed foot is the ultimate stocking stuffer.”While he was frequently compared to the comedian Stephen Wright, Mitch’s style was indelibly unique and never could be imitated. He was truly one of a kind.Unlike many comics who shy away from their fans’ attention, Mitch welcomed it. His official website encouraged fans to send in pictures of themselves posing with Mitch at his shows. One published anecdote tells of Mitch meeting a group of college students at a recent show in Florida who mentioned the stifling heat of their dorm room. Mitch knocked on their door the next morning with a brand-new air conditioner.Mitch Hedberg was popular among his peers and had many friends in the comedy community. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune quoted close friend and comedian Doug Stanhope of The Man Show as saying “He was the greatest comedian ever.”Mitch passed away in March, 2005 at the age of 37.In September of 2008, Comedy Central Records released a posthumous Mitch Hedberg album entitled “Do You Believe in Gosh?” The album was recorded two months prior to his death and had 40 minutes of new material. Coinciding with the release was “Mitch Across America” - a series of live show featuring friends and followers of the comedian both performing stand-up and telling stories about the late comedian."

Norm Macdonald,October,17,1963,Risqué,60,73.9,3095,1091,"MacDonald grew up in Quebec City, the son of two teachers. He has two brothers, both of which have gone on to be Canadian newscasters.Norm MacDonald began performing stand-up at clubs in his native Canada, first in Ottawa. His first big break was at the 1987 Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal. MacDonald has described that the stand-ups scene is strong in Canada because there was very little of the entertainment industry up there, allowing performers to focus on their stand-up as their goal, rather than getting cast in films or television.MacDonald was hired to write for the sitcom Roseanne by Bruce Helford. Norm was a big fan of Roseanne’s stand-up comedy, but he found sitcom less than interesting to him. He told Rolling Stone magazine later that he fell asleep while watching episodes to prepare for the gig.Shortly after celebrating the birth of his son in 1992, MacDonald gained the Weekend Update desk at Saturday Night Live, a perfect fit for someone who felt more comfortable as a stand-up than a sketch player. Despite that self-admitted handicap, MacDonald would play more than a few famous names on the show, including Republican Presidential candidate Bob Dole.MacDonald’s oft-kilter references to crack whores and David Hasselhoff during Weekend Update made him a fan favorite among some. One of those was Chevy Chase, who originated the segment, and claimed that MacDonald was the only one who’d done it justice since. Unfortunately those fans did not include NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer. In 1998, MacDonald was suddenly fired from SNL after Ohlymeyer pressed the show claiming that MacDonald was not funny.The outrage among some in the audience drove a media story for some time, due to reports that MacDonald’s firing was due to Ohlymeyer close friendship with O.J. Simpson. Ohlymeyer was reportedly bothered by MacDonald’s directly accusatory gags about the famous running back. The media frenzy included an appearance on the program of another former NBC late night comedy star, David Letterman. Letterman gladly joined in for Norm to insult an example of network short sightedness.1998 saw the release of MacDonald’s film “Dirty Work”, which failed to gain traction at the box office. Ohlmeyer’s continued feud with MacDonald didn’t help since NBC refused to accept advertising for the film.Norm soon found a home at ABC, thanks to his old boss Bruce Helford, who convinced the comic to let him craft a sitcom around him. The show was sooned picked up for a second season and in a piece of karmic justice perhaps, Don Ohlymer was pushed out of NBC (for many other reasons including his less than nurturing attitude to talent).Comedy Central named him number 83 in their list of the top 100 stand-up comedians of all time.2005 saw the debut of Norm MacDonald’s special “Back to Norm” on Comedy Central. Originally intended as a back door pilot to a series, the sketch show never went beyond its single episode.In 2006, Norm MacDonald released his first comedy album “Ridiculous” under the Comedy Central Records label. The CD took over nine years to produce. Ridiculous is primarily a collection of comedy sketches featuring many of MacDonald’s former SNL players including Will Ferrell, Jon Lovitz, Tim Meadows and Molly Shannon. A hidden final track gives a taste of MacDaonald’s stand-up.Norm recently made an appearance on the Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget which was much celebrated by comedy nerds for how he deconstructed the typical roast jokes, intentionally telling hoary old punchlines to atypically hysterical results.Norm released “Me Doing Stand-Up” in 2011. The performance first premiered as an hour special on Comedy Central. The CD and DVD releases are an uncut and uncensored version of the set."
Pablo Francisco,January,5,1974,Tame,19,38.6,1414,2247,"Pablo Ridson Francisco (born January 5, 1974) is an American stand-up comedian born in Tucson, Arizona now living in Los Angeles. He started his career doing improv in Tempe, Arizona. Pablo was relatively unknown until the late 1990s, when he began appearing on MADtv as a featured player. His stand-up act was finally introduced to America at large when he landed his own half-hour comedy special on Comedy Central in 2000. In 2001 and 2002, Francisco toured as part of “The Three Amigos” with Carlos Mencia and Freddy Soto. Since then he has performed on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno, VH1’s ILL-ustrated, and, most recently, Mind of Mencia as The Voiceover Dude (same as Movie Voiceover Guy).Pablo is widely recognized within the comedy business for his ability to do vocal impressions of famous people including Aaron Neville, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Count Dracula, Keanu Reeves, famously The Movie Voiceover Guy (Don LaFontaine as sourced from the Bits and Pieces DVD) as well as sound effects and more generic character voices.Pablo Francisco resides in Redondo Beach, and tours frequently in Southern California.

Patrice ONeal,December,7,1969,Dirty,49,60,2269,1515,"Patrice got his first real taste of stand-up at a place called Estelle’s in Boston. He was heckling a comic, and the comic suggested maybe Patrice thought he could do better. Patrice did and the following week he went on stage at Estelle’s and brought down the house. From there he went on to work at the Comedy Connection, then moved to working at most of the clubs in and around Boston, New England, and New York. Now, years later, Patrice has a wide range of comic toolsIn one bit, Patrice, at 6’5’’ and 300+ lbs., makes the audience hear and almost see the story of the eastern European gymnast quietly speaking of her difficult upbringing and training.The Boston Globe said, “It is a hilarious piece made all the more so by the contradiction between Oneal’s very visible presence and that of the young white girl he is playing.”Asked to whom he aspires, Patrice mentions only two names: George Carlin and Richard Pryor.Carlin for his distinct point of view and universal appeal; Pryor for his honesty, vulnerability and Personal revelation. Patrice has appeared on “The Late Show withConan O’Brien” three times and was a regular on the very popular, Comedy Central’s “Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn”. He has also performed stand-up at both the prestigious Montreal Just For Laughs and the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen.

He was 41 years old."
Patton Oswalt,January,27,1969,Risqué,160,71.4,2944,1178,"Patton Oswalt was born in Portsmouth, Virginia. As a child he moved often as he grew up in a military family. One of his first exposures to stand-up comedy was his father’s stash of Jonathan Winters records.In between his freshman and sophomore years at the College of William and Mary, Oswalt began to look for work that he thought might support himself as he pursued a writing career. One of the things he tried that summer was stand-up comedy. Despite all the frustration and difficulty that’s common to first time stand-ups, Oswalt loved it and kept coming back to perform. In 1989, he began to work open mikes in the Washington, D.C. area, the same ones that comics like Dave Chappelle worked. One of Oswalt’s first jokes was about how he would be a good idea to remove the letter f in the word “of” because it would make things sound less bad. As in “I have cancer o’ the cervix.” The joke brought his first praise from fellow comics.Oswalt immersed himself in the world of stand-up, focusing on getting as much stage time as possible. Oswalt was engaged to be married at the time, and the frequent non-paying open mikes put a strain on the relationship with his fiancee.By 1992 Oswalt and his fiancee had broken their engagement and he decided to move away from DC, whose comedy scene had turned for the worse in the early 90s stand-up bust. He headed to San Francisco, whose scene was still relatively vibrant, bringing in many comics like Dana Gould, Marc Maron and Brian Posehn. Many of the comics tended to what became known as “alternative”, simply meaning that they broke away from the norms that had put a stranglehold on stand-up. They would do what they enjoyed and hope an audience would find them and enjoy it too.Despite the vital scene, stand-up comedy as a business was still contracting, eventually leaving San Francisco with few spot where a paying gig could be found for a local. In 1995, Oswalt moved to Los Angeles, where the seeds of  many scenes gravitated. The years of two shows a night, every night paid off and Oswalt soon began headlining clubs in 1996.More recognition followed: In 1999 Variety maked him as one of their “10 Comedians to Watch.” In 2002 he was named the “It Comedian” by Entertainment Weekly.In 1999, Patton Oswalt did a Comedy Central Presents special that he disavows, saying he allowed his performance to be changed by network concerns. When he next had a special on Comedy Central, the one-hour “No Reason to Complain”, he vowed to not make the same mistake. The 2005 show is firmly his and his alone and he’s stated his pride in how the performance turned out.In 2005, Oswalt married Michelle McNamara, a writer.In 2004 he released his first comedy CD entitled “Feelin’ Kinda Patton.” It captures an edited version of a performance at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia. The full performance was made available on a record called “222” which refers to the 2 hour and 22 minute run time. Performing at rock music and other venues was a trend Patton continued in the later project “The Comedians of Comedy”, a comedy tour featuring Brian Posehn, Zach Galifianakis, Maria Bamford and himself. Different legs of the tour have been captured as documentaries. A west coast tour was made for Netflix as a movie, the second tour, which focused on the northeast, was made into a six-part series for Comedy Central. Comedians of Comedy continues past these filmed incarnations, only changing up the line-up occasionally to include comics like Eugene Mirman.Patton Oswalt has been a part of several successful movie and TV ventures in the past few years. The one that he’s most known for is his nine-year run as the character Spense on “The King of Queens.” It has occasionally affected his stand-up because of expectations that he is more like Spense than he really is, but never in a major way. He will voice the main character in the upcoming Pixar animated film “Ratatouille.” Here too, his stand-up has played a role, with Disney using Oswalt’s stand-up ties to create a stand-up contest to promote the film. Despite his success in both film and TV, Oswalt is firmly focused on stand-up, viewing those other aspects of his career as secondary.In 2007, Patton Oswalt released his second CD entitled “Werewolves and Lollipops” on the Sub Pop record label. The CD was recorded at the Cap City Comedy Club in Austin, Texas. The package will also include a DVD of a 40-minute set Oswalt performs at the 40 Watt Club.2009 saw the release of Oswalt’s second hour length special and third CD entitled “My Weakness is Strong.”"
Paul Mooney,?,NA,1940,Risqué,21,49,1856,1930,"Born in Lousiana, Paul Mooney was raised by his grandmother in Oakland. In his late teens, he ran away from home to join the circus. He eventually became the ringmaster of the Charles Gody Circus. As the “first Black ringmaster”, he discovered he enjoyed writing jokes and making the crowds laugh. Mooney continued to work as a ringmaster but also pursued comedy. Even then he would also work as a shoe salesman to make money. Mooney would work out material at “Ye Little Club” in Los Angeles, where he met Sandra Bernhard, who was only 18 at the time.In the 70s, at the height of anti-war protests against Vietnam, Mooney went on tour with Jane Fonda, Peter Boyle, and Donald Sutherland as FTA or “Fuck the Army.”Mooney met his future frequent writing partner Richard Pryor while he was living with his half-sister in Hollywood. Pryor had come by their apartment while on a date with a friend of Mooney’s sister. Pryor, not knowing Mooney’s half-sister was his sister, proposed they all “get in the bed and have a freak thing.” Mooney kicked Pryor out of the apartment. They later had a drink at a concert together that formed their bond.For much of his career, Mooney was best known as a comedy writer. Mooney often co-wrote material with Richard Pryor for his specials as well as for Pryor’s appearance on “Saturday Night Live.” He also served as the head writer for “The Richard Pryor Show.” Mooney claims to be Pryor’s biggest fan, saying that you can hear his laughter on Pryor’s albums.Mooney’s extensive writing credits include “Sanford and Son” (starring Redd Foxx), Good Times and the first season of the African American sketch comedy show “In Living Color” where he is credited with creating the character of Homey the Clown (which was performed by Damon Wayans).Paul Mooney continued his associations with rising Black comics with Dave Chappelle, a comedian who many believe has inherited Pryor’s mantle. Mooney guest stared in sketches for Chappelle’s Show, appearing as himself in the Ask a Black Dude and then in a similar segment as Negrodamus, where he again answered questions, this time as a seer. At one point, Chappelle was developing a court show with Paul Mooney.In 2006, after Michael Richards called an audience member the N-word during a well-publicized meltdown at Los Angeles’ Laugh Factory, Mooney appeared with the comic as he attempted contrition for his breakdown. He met privately with Richards as well, counseling him. Mooney described the reason he was involved because he himself was an ambassador for the N-word, using in often in his act.However soon after, Mooney renounced using the N-word himself. (His frequent collaborator Pryor has made a similar vow after visiting Africa.) Mooney found the vow difficult to keep initially. In his first performance post-oath, he narrowly completed his entirely hour long set without using the epithet. He accidentally slipped it in while performing a bit on O.J. Simpson. An embarrassed Mooney left the stage, later returning to reaffirm his commitment to no longer using the word. He has continued to reiterate the change in his act since.A later 2006 performance for the show “Showtime at the Apollo” was stopped short. Mooney claimed that he was asked to end his stand-up because of his material on President George W. Bush, intimating that executives from Time Warner were offended by what he said and called for him to leave the stage. Time Warner denied any involvement in Mooney’s removal.Mooney is bluntly honest about his feelings on race in America on stage and off. Though it’s presented in humor, some audience members have a hard time taking it that way, occasionally walking out of a performance. This can even be seen or heard on some of Mooney’s DVD and CD releases.Despite his closeness to Pryor and many other comedians, Mooney claims to have never have taken drugs, asserting that he knew that they would hurt him and his career.Mooney’s sons, who are twins, are also stand-up comics."
Pete Davidson,November,16,1993,Risqué,5,48.2,190,204,"Peter Davidson was born in Staten Island on November 16, 1993, and raised Catholic. Davidson’s father, Scott Davidson, a firefighter in Brooklyn Heights, died on 9/11. He was attempting to evacuate survivors when the Marriot World Trade Center Hotel collapsed on him. Pete was only 7 at the time and claims that he acted out in school to deal with his anger over his father’s passing. Davidson has 343, his father’s firefighting unit number, tattooed on his arm. Years later, Davidson would lead the campaign criticizing fellow comedian Steve Rannazzisi’s false 9/11 claims. To cope with his severe teenage depression, Davidson started listening to rap and writing jokes. However, he was hesitant to try out his material in part because it was so personal. His friends finally convinced him to perform at a Staten Island bowling alley when Davidson was 16. Davidson was discovered by comedian Nick Cannon, who brought Davidson on his radio show and improv-based TV show Wild N’ Out. From there Davidson performed stand-up on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Gotham Comedy Live, Adam Devine’s House Party, and Comedy Underground with Dave Attell. In 2014, Davidson was announced as a featured member on SNL’s 40th season. He was only twenty at the time, making him one of the youngest cast members ever and the only current featured player born in the nineties. He typically plays up his youth in his appearances, especially on Weekend Update, where he has described himself as the show’s stoned younger brother. Davidson openly talks about his marijuana use on and off stage. In 2016, he told High Times that he was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, a painful gastrointestinal disease that affects appetite, when he was 17 and that marijuana helped combat the side effects of the disease better than any prescribed drugs. He added that performing without weed is possible but not pleasurable. However, in his 2016 Comedy Central Special SMD, he joked that he went to rehab as a Christmas gift to his mother and expressed an interest in moving away from his druggie persona. In a 2017 Instagram post, Davidson announced that he was sober for the first time in 8 years. A few days later, he confirmed his sobriety on SNL and announced his excitement about finally having boners in the morning. Bio by Andy Gause"

Ralphie May,February,17,1972,Risqué,25,48.1,1853,2002,"Tennessee-born Ralphie May knew he wanted to perform comedy since he was nine years old. He got his first opportunity to do so at just 13, at a talent show for a church youth group.At 16, May was in a serious car accident, breaking 42 bones in his body. He was in a coma for 10 days. May says he can still feel the effects of the accident on rainy days.At only 17, May won a radio talent contest that would allow him to open up for Sam Kinison, who was at the height of his popularity. May says that Kinison advised him to close with cussing out the audience, assuring the young May that the 3000-plus audience would go nuts for it.However, it was only a setup. The audience immediately booed May off the stage and Sam came out and roared with approval with the crowd. A distraught May was about to leave when he was stopped by Sam’s brother Bill, who told him that Kinison thought May was funny and that he should stick around to party. Kinison encouraged May to move to Houston, a comedy scene which birthed both Kinison and Bill Hicks.Kinison referred him to his home club in Houston, the Comedy Workshop. However by the time May could move to Houston, the club had closed. May instead found work at Houston’s Comedy Showcase, a club that appealed to black audiences. Many of May’s first TV appearances are on “Urban” showcases.America’s first big introduction to May was during the first season of the NBC reality series “Last Comic Standing.” Performing and living in a house with nine other comics, May became an audience favorite and many were surprised and outraged when May finished second to Dat Phan. May has said that he believe his weight may have been what prevent him from winning the show. May has weighed as much as 800 pounds in the past.Ralphie soon was able to capitalize on his new audience with his first hour special called “Just Correct.” A special feature of the DVD is footage of his performances on the USO Tour in Iraq.Ralphie May’s second special and comedy album was somewhat of a homecoming to Tennesse. “Girth of a Nation” was performed in Knoxville in April of 2006. It aired on Comedy Central later that year.In 2008, Ralphie was named one of Variety’s 10 Comics to Watch. That year also saw the release of “Austin-tatious”, a 90 minutes special filmed, naturally, in Austin, Texas at the Paramount Theater.May prides himself on unique material… when he writes a new bit, he’ll often ask other comedians if they’ve heard a similar joke. If it is a little close to another comedian’s material, May will trash it, even if the other material hasn’t been performed for over 20 years. May has had some recent health scares. In November of 2011, May contracted pneumonia while on a cruise ship. Following that, a blog clot from his leg caused him to suffer a pulmonary embolism. The experience scared May so much that he attempted to not sleep for 11 days while in the hospital, fearing he would die in his sleep.The events have caused May to make some changes. He gave up smoking pot and has begun to take drugs to accelerate his low metabolism. May current weighs less than 400 pounds.May is married to Lahna Turner, a fellow comedian. They wed in 2005. After having two children, they divorced in October 2015.Ralphie May died of cardiac arrest on October 6, 2017. For several weeks prior, he had been battling pneumonia but still continued to perform his show “No Apologies” as part of his residency at Harrah’s Las Vegas. Just two days prior to his death he won Casino Comedian of the Year."
Ray Romano,December,21,1957,Tame,19,59.2,2348,1621,"They all laughed at the very idea: “Everybody Loves Raymond.” Raymond who? Ray Romano seemed like a very ordinary comedian with a voice misplaced in his kidneys somewhere instead of his throat. At best, he was a younger David Brenner with a few fresh anecdotal stories about growing up.But nestled into a Monday night line-up anchored by veteran star of family fare Bill Cosby, Romano’s show began to gather steam. And while his version of a family sitcom was filled with bellicose insults hurled by various cast members at each other, fans recognized there was some kind of love between Ray and his parents, and soon enough, everybody seemed to be watching. Ray Romano had a Top Ten hit.He’d come a long way from a whimsical decision to perform on an open mike night in a local comedy club. He did it to impress his date: “It was the girl’s birthday, and I wanted to give her a unique birthday present.” Romano, born and raised in Queens, New York, had always been able to get his friends chuckling over his anecdotes. It worked in front of an audience of strangers as well.In 1984 he began to work the local clubs, graduating to headliner. Merely an affable entertainer, hardly distinctive, Romano seemed to thrive as another of the “blue collar” comics and road warriors who went out, did a pleasanat night’s work, and collected a decent check. His laidback attitude turned into his most defined trait.“I’m glad that my career moved at the pace it did,” he reflects, “If you’re an overnight success, where do you go?”In 1989, the journeyman comic won a comedy competition sponsored by a beer company and a local New York rock radio station. He won $10,092 and some important publicity. He went on to the “Just For Laughs Festival” in Canada, the HBO 15th Annual Young Comedians Special and appearances with Jay Leno and David Letterman. Letterman became a big fan, and in 1996 signed Ray for sitcom development.From a pleasant stand-up, Romano emerged at last as, in his phrase, a “likably clueless” sitcom character. Fame hasn’t changed him much. He is a homebody, caring for his four children and sympathizing with wife Anna: “She’s home alone with kids, kids, kids. When she sees me, she wants to be mentally stimulated. But I’ve been talking all day at work. I’m talked out.” So what do they do? “We yell. We argue about me not wanting to talk, and that becomes our conversation.”Romano’s observations have struck a chord with both husbands and wives. His advice for other guys is simple: Accept your cluelessness. Don’t fight it…ask for your wife’s help and appreciate it. That’s endearing to women.” His advice on aging is equally simple. “I trick myself. I imagine I’m 48, 49, wishing I was 40 again. Then I realize I am 40, and it’s great to be 40.” And here’s some advice away from home…when you’re staying in a hotel: “It doesn’t pay to be a nice guy when you’re checking in. If you seem like the type who won’t complain, they’ll give you an undesirable room, like the one near the dumpster. Say ‘Give me the room you’ll give me when I don’t like the first one.’”In 1999, Ray dusted off some of his older material, wrote up some new observations, and alot of fans and book critics loved ““Everything and a Kite,” which is something to do on the other six nights when “Raymond” isn’t on the air."
Richard Pryor,December,1,1940,Dirty,99,79.6,3477,893,"The most controversial stand-up comedian of the late 70’s, Richard Pryor fused together several styles of comedy. From the old Pigmeat Markham “open the door, Richard” school, he enlarged upon black dialect. From Lenny Bruce he learned how to deal with racial or sexual tensions without flinching from painful truths. And in the tradition of clowning contemporaries like Bill Cosby and George Carlin, he put it all together with manic faces and voices that made a “one man” concert seem more like a three-ring circus. Sometimes it all came together in one routine:“I don’t mind women leavin’ me…but they tell you why. Fuck that, just leave…‘cause there ain’t shit you can say when they’re talkin’ to you. You know it’s true, all you can do is stand there and look silly…but women come back at your ass though. (Pryor to his woman) “I’m gonna find me some new pussy!” (Imitating the woman) ‘Yeah? You had two more inches of dick you’d find some new pussy here!’ ‘I know the dick was good to you. If it wasn’t good why was you hollerin’?’ ‘I was hollerin’ to keep from laughin’ in your face…’ Women are funny, Jack. They can regroup out of anything. You ever be makin’ love and air get in the pussy? (Outrageous sound effects). Women recover beautiful: ‘It’s talkin’ to ya, Daddy!’”It wasn’t just the language that made Pryor infamous, though he was far more graphic than the latest trailblazer, Carlin. Pryor was the first comedian since Lenny Bruce to wrestle with dangerous racial humor, most of it intended more to amuse his own people and secondarily any whites who might dare to be hipped to his point of view. Fellow comedians, critics and white liberals flocked to hear “the truth,” while other whites called his act offensively “reverse-racist” at worst, merely rambling and obscene at best. The more controversy there was, the bigger Pryor’s star became, with many acclaiming him a genius, while others, quoting one of his comedy album titles, felt “That Nigger’s Crazy.”Pryor was born in Peoria. Interviewers asking about his childhood years generally got evasive answers, hazy recollections or a few angry or pathetic recollections that might have been fact or fiction. Lenny Bruce was often the same way, even in his autobiography. One undisputed fact was that his parents separated and he was raised by his grandmother. After tough years on the streets, Pryor left high school and joined the Army. Afterward he became an mc, comic, and following Bill Cosby’s lead, a mildly swinging performer welcomed on TV variety shows of the day. At the turn of the 70’s he grew tired of the safe and phony routines he was doing, dropped out, and emerged with a tougher, hipper identity.In 1972 he earned an Academy Award nomination for his acting in “Lady Sings the Blues.” He won a 1973 Emmy as a writer (“The Lily Tomlin Special”) and worked on Mel Brooks’ movie about a black sheriff out west, “Blazing Saddles.” Warner Bros. rejected Pryor for the lead in the film, choosing Cleavon Little instead. In 1974, 1975 and 1976 he won Grammy awards for his hot, controversial comedy and was nominated the next four years in a row. He won twice more in 1980 and 1981.Among his many accomplishments, Pryor re-introduced stark drama to stand-up (his “Mudbone” monologues and other routines that did not go for the laugh every 20 seconds) and fractured ground rules on censorship (unlike Carlin, no one seemed ready to risk a riot by arresting Richard). The first stand-up comic to achieve box office success with a “performance” film, Pryor proved to the show business industry that people would be willing to watch one man on a stage for 90 minutes. A flood of stand-up films, videos and cable TV specials followed, for Pryor and for the rest who came after.Pryor’s more orthodox movie comedies of the day were hits, too. Pryor’s mousy presence—the quivering voice, the popping eyes, the disbelieving and fearful expression—were not that far removed from black stereotypes in older films. The difference was that in addition to mirroring real fear and vulnerability, Pryor’s film characters were hip and heroic. His first film teamed with the gentle, white Gene Wilder, gave him his biggest hit, a “crossover” success among fans of all types.Under pressure to constantly top himself, his own anger, suspicions and confusion rising with every fawning honor, interview request, or critique either pro or con, Pryor reacted with ever more open and potent iconoclasm and outrageousness. Aside from whatever he said on stage, off-stage he made headlines by insulting talk show hosts, ridiculing other performers, and inciting the occasional murder: “If you’re black and still here in America,” he said on “The Tonight Show” in 1979, “get a gun and go to South Africa and kill some white people.” His behavior set new standards for celebrity frankness. Ten years before angry boxer Larry Holmes said almost the same thing, Pryor shocked the crowd at a 1977 Human Rights Foundation benefit by saying “kiss my happy, rich black ass.” At that same event, he sneered at homosexuals for mincing about “on Hollywood Boulevard while Watts was burning down.”Pryor’s personal life was even more of a shambles. His latest wife had to run for cover when he opened fire at his own car in the midst of an irrational shooting spree. Pryor’s drug use led to a heart attack. And on June 9, 1980, he tried to kill himself. Trying to get the truth out of Pryor was difficult at the time. At first he insisted he had accidentally set fire to himself while pouring a drink. Later the accepted theory was that he had been freebasing cocaine when the mixture exploded. Finally, in 1986, he told Barbara Walters that he’d lied: “My lawyer had made a statement—he didn’t know the truth…he was trying to cover my ass. So I was trying to cover his ass…I wanted to say it was no accident, I got crazy one night and wanted to kill myself….I remember pouring rum all over myself…I was ashamed of myself…I could only end up in a room smoking a base pipe…”Pryor made a miraculous recovery from almost certain death, and to his surprise, the outlaw comic received overwhelming support from his peers and his fans. His life and death struggle was front page news around the country.The struggle back to stardom remained. Pryor had a lot of trouble getting his comic act together. Perhaps the anger that had fueled so much of his work had been eroded by the outpouring of affection after the accident. Perhaps, as he said, going “straight” without alcohol or drugs had dried up some of his wild imagination. There was also the inhibiting factor of the long lay-off and the slight concern that fans might notice a few scars or see a new vulnerability in this once-burned and now shy performer.Pryor did make a successful comeback and even created a routine about his burn experience and recovery, but by now, there was another hot new comedian around: Eddie Murphy. In the less tense early 80’s, Murphy’s happy sense of outrage and fresh, Pryor-influenced inventions eclipsed the now familiar routines of his idol. Several mediocre comedies weakened Pryor’s box office appeal. Asked how he felt about Murphy’s success, Pryor remarked: “Pissed off…I don’t like it at all….my wife helped me…she said, ‘You was #1 for a long time…”His re-union film with Gene Wilder, “See No Evil, Hear No Evil” and “Harlem Nights” with Eddie Murphy were roasted by critics. Fans hoped that if he wasn’t enjoying great movie success, at least his personal life was straightening out. Unfortunately peculiar health problems began to surface. He looked emaciated on a “Tonight Show” appearance in 1986 as alarmed host Johnny Carson by intimating he had some kind of fatal disease like AIDS: “I thought Richard, it’s finally caught up with you. I thought I had one of them and I was going to die…my right eye is blind. You could hit me on this side and I wouldn’t see it coming.” Gossip writer Liz Smith quoted an ex-wife as saying he had used needles in his drug abuse. Pryor himself had once talked about homosexual experimentation, but said it had happened many years ago. In March of 1990 he suffered a second heart attack, this time while golfing in Australia.On April 1, 1990, Pryor, whose previous brides varied between white, Jewish and black, re-married his fifth wife, Flynn, a Jehovah’s witness. She said he had proposed after returning from Australia: “He told me he wanted to spend his last days around people who love him.” In May of 1991 Pryor’s spokesman, Guy McElwaine confirmed that for the past five years Pryor was suffering from multiple sclerosis, but that it was in remission. In June he underwent triple heart bypass surgery. A month later critics noted Pryor’s weakened physical condition as he struggled through the summer ‘91 release “Another You,” his fourth teaming with Gene Wilder."
Ricky Gervais,June,25,1961,Risqué,36,69.2,2831,1258,"Something of a late-starter, at least in terms of comedy, Ricky is well aware that his chosen route to success whilst preferable, was certainly not typical. Born in Reading in the early sixties, he made it to university in London where he breezed his way through to a degree in philosophy. After a brief career in a pop band he dallied with the odd job here and there making ends meet before a longish stint running the entertainments at a students’ union. The long years of discos, pub quizzes and guitar bands were punctuated with brief dabblings in the music business. He managed a band called Suede for a bit (walking away shortly before they were signed), promoted a Queen tribute band and generally bothered music industry types with his unfocussed ambitions. Following that came a portentous appointment with the then fledgling and unlicensed radio station Xfm. It was here that Ricky took on a new assistant, Stephen Merchant, who would later become co-writer/director of ‘The Office’. Although Ricky wasn’t hired to be a broadcaster, he quite fancied giving it a go and a nightly program was slotted into the schedule ready for the station’s proper launch on 1 September 1997 (not the best choice of dates as it turned out). Five nights a week plus the day-job is clearly too much for anyone to manage. And all that talking to do in between records? Obviously you need at least one other person involved to share the burden. So a lone late-night ten-hours became 120 minutes on a Sunday afternoon chatting to a mate. “I’m Ricky Gervais… obviously. With me; Steve Merchant”. They’ve been doing it off and on ever since. In 1998, Xfm was acquired by Capital Radio and format changes to Xfm saw Ricky free to explore his comedy talents in other media. A bit of sketch writing here and there, popping up on Radio 1 every so often, followed by first appearances on the TV; Ricky wrote and starred in a one-off called ‘Golden Years’ about a businessman who is obsessed with becoming a David Bowie lookalike. Remember, write about what you know. ‘The 11 O’Clock Show’ - a topical comedy magazine series. Ricky adopts the persona of a half-knowledgable bigot to drop in on the regular team of presenters. An outrageous and refreshingly funny foil to the satirical Oxbridge pretentions of the show itself. ‘Meet Ricky Gervais’ came hot on the heels of Ricky’s popularity in the 11 O’Clock Show. Conceived as a chat show with games, the structure mainly served to allow Ricky the opportunity to say rude words, make guests say rude words and make it all official by virtue of the fact that it was being shown on TV. That said, a running gag filmed and written by Ricky and Stephen Merchant as links between ad breaks showed a glimpse of what was to come. The show finished in October 2000, but Ricky and Steve had already been developing their ideas for an office-based mock documentary, and months if not years of work would come to fruition on 9 July 2001 when the BBC aired the first episode of ‘The Office’. Twelve episodes and a two-part Christmas special later and The Office is consigned to broadcasting history as one of the most perfectly crafted comedy series in British TV ever. Showered with awards and critical acclaim the series’ pivotal creation David Brent became a household name and so, of course, did Ricky. Perhaps slightly embarrassed by the accolades and not having earned his comedy spurs by years of telling jokes to drunks in smoky bars up and down the country, Ricky put together a stand-up show to while away the evenings away from home during filming. The resulting tour, encompassing at least two theatres within a mile radius of his house, was a smash and must have dispelled any lingering doubts about doing live work as he’s followed the ‘Animals’ show this year with a new show entitled ‘Politics’. And it was a proper UK tour this time too with shows in as many as six places outside London. With seven and a half hours of The Office produced in a three year period you wouldn’t think there’d be time enough for anything else would you? But you’d be wrong of course. Voice-overs in ads, animated films and the like, small parts in films - generally for mates, a cameo role in an American TV series called ‘Alias’ plus regular appearances on top chat shows like ‘Parkinson’ and ‘Friday Night With Jonathan Ross’. He even found time to take part in a four-week training regime culminating with him beating a minor celebrity in a televised boxing match. In the run-up to Christmas this year, Ricky will be busy telling us about his new book - ‘Flanimals’. Ostensibly aimed at younger readers, but the richness of the illustrations and the inventiveness of the text give it universal appeal. DVDs of the Politics show and The Office Specials are also out for Christmas so expect to see lots of cardboard cut-outs of Ricky in stores over the next few weeks. After that it’ll be full steam ahead for ‘Extras’, his new TV series - more about that to come. One last thing - many online biographies make reference to Ricky having worked as a pizza deliveryman. Just to put record straight, Ricky has not ever delivered a pizza… eaten, yes. Lots. Too many probably. But delivered them? Never."
Rob Schneider,?,NA,NA,Risqué,4,54.7,146,121,"Emmy-nominated actor Rob Schneider is known the world over for his trademark blend of character and comedic acting.Schneider recently inked a deal with TRiCon Films and Television for the international distribution of his new television comedy series, “Real Rob.” The self-financed, eight-episode, independently produced comedy series was directed, co-written and stars Schneider with his real life wife, Mexican television producer Patricia Azarcoya. “Real Rob” comes two years after “Rob,” the CBS sitcom that Schneider also wrote, produced, and starred in. CBS’s “Rob” premiered to an audience of 13.5 million viewers and averaged 11 million viewers over the run of its 8 episodes. When CBS chose not to pick up the show, Schneider said, “Eleven million viewers is not enough for them, it’s enough for me. I’ll do it myself.” Schneider is the first actor to have written, produced, starred, directed and self-financed an entire season of a television show. The second season of “Real Rob” will begin filming this summer. Schneider recently completed filming The Ridiculous Six with Adam Sandler. This is the first feature film from Netflix, who hopes to have the same success with feature films as they did with their first TV series, House of Cards. This film marks the eighteenth collaboration between the Sandler and Schneider.  Their longtime friendship has spanned some twenty-five years and produced comedic hits such as Grown Ups, You Don’t Mess With The Zohan, 50 First Dates, Big Daddy and The Waterboy. Sandler’s production company, Happy Madison, produced several films written by and starring Schneider, including Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, which was the second highest grossing DVD in the US in 2000, The Hot Chick and The Animal. Schneider has appeared in 50 films. He has co-starred with Sylvester Stallone, Rachael McAdams, Steve Buscemi, David Carradine, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Kelsey Grammer, David Spade, Kevin James, Chris Rock and M. Emmet Walsh, among many others. Schneider’s films have grossed over $2.6 billion in North America alone. In 2009, after a nearly twenty-year hiatus, Schneider made his return to stand-up comedy. He has released two albums since then, Registered Offender and Soy Sauce and the Holocaust, and has received rave reviews for his international comedy tours.Schneider began writing jokes as a teenager, appearing at local comedy clubs such as the “Holy City Zoo,” which was made famous by Robin Williams. Schneider made his major network television debut in 1987 performing stand-up on “The David Letterman Show.” In 1989 Lorne Michaels saw Schneider’s appearance on HBO’s “13th Annual Young Comedians Special” and hired him as a writer on “Saturday Night Live.” Schneider quickly became a regular. During his four seasons at “SNL,” Schneider created characters that people around the country imitated and adored, including the “copy machine guy,” the “orgasm guy,” and the “put your weed in there guy.” He performed memorable sketches with Charlton Heston, John Malkovich, Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum, Joe Pesci and others. As part of the SNL writing staff, Schneider was nominated for three Emmys and won a Peabody Award.Schneider, born and raised in Northern California, has been a lifelong San Francisco Giants baseball fan. In each of their three World Series Championship runs, Rob was asked to come out onto the field and cheer the team and its fans to victory.Rob lives in the Los Angeles area with his wife Patricia and their daughter Miranda."
Robin Williams,July,21,1952,Risqué,46,66.4,2831,1434,"Robin Williams, while struggling for addictions for coccaine and alcohol, has not had his stand-up marked by them, staying more playful rather than raw. As a youth, Robin lived a lonely life fulfilled only in fantasy. His father was a wealthy executive with Ford Motors and Robin lived in a 30 room mansion. He had an entire floor to himself as well as the use of the expansive basement that housed his two thousand toy soldiers. The chubby kid played down there, bringing his soldiers to life with sound effects and voices. When the family moved to California, the teenager went out for sports and turned into a slim, rather attractive young man well suited for his chosen career: acting. He attended Juilliard on a scholarship and trained with one of the severe-but-fun masters of the acting profession, John Houseman.Williams enjoyed improvisations and found an outlet in comedy clubs. Influenced strongly by Jonathan Winters, Williams discovered he too could blitz audiences with the virtuosity of his voices and the hectic pace of his quick-change characterizations. In hip clubs where the clientele was often on booze, drugs or both, Williams seemed like a human cartoon—every now and then there was a scripted joke but the thrill was in the funny faces, funny voices and the energetic, improbable contortions.If Morey Amsterdam had been a “human joke machine,” Williams was the modern computer, a computer programmed with old jokes and new twists, the best influences of both great comedians and great actors, plus inexhaustible energy. What came out was like a computer gone berzerk: all the ad-libs, improv, jokes and vocal impressions spewing out at once like confetti. And that became something unique: Robin Williams.Other comics grumbled when Robin borrowed their jokes or catch-phrases, but he wasn’t intentionally stealing. He was a computer on overload, spitting out everything in its memory. The material was sometimes an extension of acting class (his bit “inside the mind” of a bombing comic), sometimes easy (Jack Nicholson doing “Hamlet,” Elmer Fudd singing rock songs) and often typical of the nightclub (a quick grab for the crotch to make sure “Mr. Happy” was home). But it was a fresh and innovative mix circa 1981. Like a brilliant rock guitarist or jazz musician, the virtuosity was enough at first. After several years, he became smoother, structured the improv “melody” with a steady beat (real jokes inserted periodically for structure) and serious, identifiable themes. He reached a peak in 1986 with his concert at the Metropolitan Opera House. The once merry prankster wasn’t sweating over his impression of “The Fly” in a 50’s horror movie or making fun of ringsiders’ drinks. He was straining and gasping over world problems, drugs, women’s rights, and children facing the future. While there were still plenty of easy laughs and schtick and George Jessel impressions, the underlying theme was innocence crying out for change in the world and to change the world. Williams, who favored childlike clothing (pants with suspenders and striped t-shirts), was persuasive as a symbol of youth newly confronting life’s realities (his catch-phrase: “Reality! What a concept!”).It wasn’t just funny—it was touching. Williams envisioned the United Nations as “a traffic cop on Valium” wearily crying “Staaahp, staaahp. Best thing for the UN to do is go condo! It’s scary times!” He still wasn’t profound, but his comic frustrations and agonies were real.By this time, there were many other avenues for his creativity, many ways to experiment with roles that often used his strengths as a youthful idealist or innocent. On TV, Williams had begun his career as one of the “zanies” of the new version of “Laugh-In.” Then he landed the role that made him a national star (something his stand-up hadn’t quite accomplished). He was Mork, the naive alien from the planet Ork on “Mork and Mindy.” The premise allowed Williams to do what every child does—point out the strange and foolish world of the adults. Most of the comedy was light and cute, the emphasis more on silly space-alien catch-phrases (“Na-nu na-nu”) and his ability to mimic everything in sight. But the show was still close to the truth. Mork, like Robin Williams as a child, and like most people at one time or another, felt alone in a strange world, needing love.Finally, in films, Williams progressed beyond easy laughs. It was a difficult transition. Director Robert Altman’s film version of “Popeye” was strangely dark and moody, and though Williams could mimick the familiar voices and mannerisms of the heroic sailor, this was not his strength. A few more films like this, and film studios were doubting Williams’ box office potential.“Moscow on the Hudson” was a mild hit, the sentimental story of a naive, eccentric Russian searching for a new life in America and facing a whole baffling new world. His first big hit was “Good Morning, Saigon,” playing a disc jockey who, like most teens in his early 60’s audience, was happy playing silly tunes and telling goofy jokes—until the nightmare of the Vietnam war began to shoot away at his innocence. In his Academy Award nominated “Dead Poet’s Society,” Williams and his character grew. How he was using his own optimism and energy to influence naive schoolkids as they began facing the realities of the world.Off-stage, fans saw how the realities of stardom affected Robin. As he went from $25,000 for a 1978 HBO special to $750,000 for a 1983 concert, and from a minor cast member of “Laugh-In” to a huge TV and movie star, he lived in a fast-lane that included drug abuse. On a Barbara Walters TV special, Williams admitted his cocaine use was “a great way of escaping.” The overdose death of his friend John Belushi was a sad, literally sobering event. Unfortunately Williams’ first marriage was another casualty of the changes in his lifestyle. He married a second time and with his children Zachary and Zelda, found a stable home environment matched by healthful regimes of yoga, exercise and a vegeterian diet. His professional life became a balance of the two things that brought him the most satisfaction—acting and stand-up. When he is out promoting a new film, he’ll still jump into a local club and surprise the cheering crowd with a half hour of ad-libs and comic frenzy. “For me it’s therapy. Stand-up is the freest form of comedy, and also the scariest…I went to a therapist for a while, but I think that I can deal with my fears better up on stage…it’s healthier for me.” Just how he creates his comedy remains a mystery: “Analyzing comedy is like peeling an onion. You peel a layer, peel a layer, peel a layer, and then you go: “There’s nothing there.” Often described as free-associating.With movies beckoning, stand-up for Robin went by the wayside. The manic energy of his performances could only be seen in guest spots on a variety of talk shows and stints of hosting events like Comic Relief with pals Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg. But in 2002, he returned to stand-up comedy, undertaking a 36 city tour of the United States. His twenty years away from stand-up brought out large crowds and culminated in a performance on Broadway entitled “Robin Williams: Live on Broadway” which was broadcast live, as the title suggested, by HBO and later released on DVD.In later years, the skills he learned as a stand-up have served him while visiting the middle east to boost morale for the armed forced stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan.With his trademark of exuberance and energy, Robin Williams became a blazing star in stand-up, TV and ultimately films. Though he rose in show business like a meteor, his early years were more like life on a cold, distant planet."
Ron White,December,18,1956,Tame,32,57.8,2349,1714,"Comedian Ron “Tater Salad” White is probably best known as the cigar smoking, scotch drinking funnyman from the “Blue Collar Comedy” phenomenon. But in 2006, with two Grammy nominations, a new CD and DVD, his second one-hour special on Comedy Central and a New York Times Best Selling book, Ron has established himself as a star in his own right.From January 2000 through March 2003, Ron performed with Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy in the highly acclaimed “Blue Collar Comedy Tour,” a show that played to sold out audiences in over 90 cities and grossed over $15 million dollars. Warner Bros filmed the tour and “Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie” was released as a major motion picture in theaters in March 2003 and later premiered on Comedy Central as the highest rated movie in the channel’s history.Ron has always been a storyteller, from the time he was a boy growing up in a small town in the middle of Texas oil country to selling windows for a living in Arlington to performing in sold-out theaters and arenas as a headlining comedian all across the country. For two decades he lived the life of a struggling comedian bouncing around to comedy clubs and driving to gigs in his beat-up Nissan pickup. In short, he paid his dues.Ron’s first solo comedy CD, “Drunk In Public,” was released in November 2003 showcasing the insightful and hilarious White, who manages to be both razor-sharp and blunt. The comedy CD has been in the Top 10 of the Billboard Comedy Charts since February 2004 and has sold over 450,000 copies. Ron’s “Drunk In Public” tour was ranked in the top 50 in Pollstar Magazine 2004 and #63 in 2005.Also that year, his first one-hour comedy special, “They Call Me Tater Salad” earned Comedy Central the highest rated Sunday in its history and the DVD companion has sold 1.3 million copies to date and has been certified multi-platinum. If that’s not enough, “The Ron White Show,” a comedy special for the WB network, was filmed in Las Vegas and aired in April 2005 with 4 million viewers. The show helped propel the network to one of its best Thursday nights of the season.Ron’s second and current one-hour special, “You Can’t Fix Stupid” was filmed in January 2006 at the Majestic Theater in Dallas, TX. The special aired on Comedy Central to 4.5 million viewers to make it the 3rd largest audience in Comedy Central’s history and the #1 show in prime time on basic cable. The comedy CD of the same name was released on February 7, 2006 by Image Entertainment and premiered at #14 on Billboard’s Top 200, ranked #1 on the Billboard Comedy Charts for 9 consecutive weeks and has been nominated for a 2007 Grammy Award. Ron received a second 2007 Grammy nomination for the CD, “Blue Collar Comedy Tour - One For The Road.”In June 2006, Penguin Books released Ron ‘Tater Salad’ White: I Had The Right To Remain Silent…But I Didn’t Have the Ability. The book debuted at #15 on the New York Times Best Seller List. It perfectly sums up Ron’s life and his comedy and is filled with over 80 illustrations by acclaimed artist Matthew Shultz.

Rory Scovel,August,6,1980,Risqué,4,48.1,194,209,"Growing up in Greenville, South Carolina, Rory Scovel would channel his hyperactive energy into basketball, soccer, tennis, and goofing around. Ultimately, his lanky body and proclivity for weed led him to only go pro in goofing around.After graduating from University of South Carolina Upstate, Rory was inspired by the work of fellow southern comedian David Cross to perform open mics in the local area. He eventually made his way up to Washington D.C., where he performed for three years, then on to New York for another three years. During his trip up the East Coast, Scovel honed his infectious goofy energy and improv-heavy set.Like fellow Carolinian Zach Galifianakis, Scovel’s act mixes absurd non-sequiturs and faux audience disdain with light-hearted wordplay, silly voices, and occasional piano playing. His work contains numerous references to his upbringing in South Carolina and routinely features a perplexed southern gentleman commenting on the sinful modern world in an exaggerated drawl.He released his first hour-long stand-up album “Dilation!” in 2011. A huge music nerd, Scovel performed his second album, 2013’s “Rory Scovel Live at Third Man Records,” at Jack White’s famous recording headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee. This record is only available in vinyl.Recently, Scovel has garnered online attention with several absurd Andy Kaufman-esque Conan appearances, including one in which he dons a tuxedo and acts like a suave yet unhinged nightclub singer, and another with comedian Jon Dore in which he pretends the show has accidentally booked two guests.Scovel filmed his first hour special, 2015’s Rory Scovel: the Charleston Special, with his own money. The special was the first released on the all-comedy streaming network Seeso. Scovel subsequentally released it on his website for $5 in the same way Louie C.K. released Live at the Comedy Store. Scovel opened for Louie earlier in their careers.Scovel’s second hour special - the facetiously titled “Rory Scovel Tries Stand-Up for the First Time” - premieres on June 20 on Netflix.Bio by Andy Gause"

Russell Brand,June,4,1975,Dirty,23,43.2,1717,2262,"Described by the Telegraph as “the most talented stand-up comedian to emerge in Britain so far this decade,” Russell Brand made his theatrical debut, aged 15, in “Bugsy Malone” as Fat Sam. Essex Council decreed it criminally neglectful to allow his chameleon-like ability to put on hats to go un-nurtured and promptly funded an education at the fancy Italia Conti stage school, which led to a three-year scholarship at the acclaimed Camden Drama Centre.In his spare time Russell began performing stand-up in pubs around London and reached the final of Hackney Empire’s prestigious “New Act of the Year” competition. He was denied the victory (allegations of jury rigging came to naught) but was a runner-up, and his angry political rantings caught the eye of Time Out’s Malcolm Hay, who dubbed him “Essex’s Bill Hicks.”Further gigs at the Empire followed, as did a successful run at the Edinburgh Festival, which garnered glowing reviews and an appearance in the “So You Think You’re Funny?” final.MTV caught Russell’s show at the festival and gave him his own series, “Dance Floor Chart,” where he bantered bizarrely with intoxicated youths in discos. Additionally he presented “Select,” their flagship peak-time phone-in show. When “Jackass” arrived in Blighty, Russell was afforded the dubious privilege of promoting it for MTV UK.“Re:Brand” followed for UK Play, which was “a challenging look at cultural taboos.” Over ten episodes Russell had a boxing match with his father (long before Dennis v. Mortimer), had a bath with a homeless man who he had living in his bed, acted as pimp to a heroin addicted prostitute and tried to convert the leader of the young BNP to socialism.He then presented his own Sunday afternoon show for Xfm, acted in Channel Four’s “White Teeth” and featured in the Steve Coogan vehicle “Cruise of the Gods.” He also hosted and wrote “The Russell Brand Show” for Channel Four’s Comedy Lab series.Summer 2004 saw Russell host E4’s live Big Brother discussion series “Efourum,” and present “Kings of Comedy” for E4, in between which Russell took his one man show “Better Now” to the Edinburgh Festival. A hilariously honest chronicle of Russell’s odyssey through a twilight world of whores, heroin and hairdos, it demonstrated that the road of excess leads to the palace of unemployment. The show was a complete sell-out and received four and five star reviews in The Times, The Guardian, The Scotsman and The Metro amongst others.Russell hosted the NME Awards in 2006 and, the same month, performed alongside Noel Gallagher to a sold-out KOKO in aid of addiction charity Focus 12. The release of his first ever live DVD followed two weeks later. During this time Russell also announced a major UK tour for 2007. After opening at Southampton’s Guild Hall on February 3, the extensive stand-up show travelled across the country, hitting over 30 venues.Recently, Russell won an award for best UK performer in a non-acting role at the Broadcasting Press Guild’s “33rd Annual Television and Radio Awards.” Other accolades he has received include Time Out’s “Stand-Up Comedian of the Year” (2006), Loaded Lafta Awards’ “Funniest Man” and “Best Newcomer” at the 2006 British Comedy Awards. He was also named GQ’s “Most Stylish Man of the Year” for 2006.2007 was Russell’s most successful year to date. He continued to tour the UK and, in March, performed at London’s Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. He also began 6Music’s Sunday morning slot in 2007, which increased audience ratings by 40 percent.One of Radio 2’s primetime presenters, Russell also hosted the 2007 BRIT Awards and, on July 7, presented “Live Earth” to an audience of billions. Russell returned to Channel 4 later that year to host “Ponderland,” which aired on Monday, October 22 and screened every weeknight that week.Towards the end of last year, Russell dominated the comedy circuit with his smash-hit, sold-out show “Only Joking.” He also made his feature film debut, starring in contemporary Ealing caper “St Trinian’s,” opposite Rupert Everett, Colin Firth, Stephen Fry and Emily Watson.In November 2007 Russell’s autobiography “My Booky Wook” was published by Hodder & Stoughton and rapidly topped the best-seller list, becoming the most successful book of the season, and going on to win a prestigious Nibby at the at the British Book Awards in the “Best Biography” category.February 2008 saw Russell follow up his 2007 debut with a role in modern fairytale “Penelope” (starring Christina Ricci and James McAvoy), while the summer brought rave reviews for Russell’s scene-stealing performances in Judd Apatow’s “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.” He also appeared in Adam Sandler’s “Bedtime Stories” in December 2008.Russell’s hour-long stand-up special, “Russell Brand in New York City,” premiered on Comedy Central in March 2009. It is now available for digital download on Xbox, Zune, iTunes and Amazon."
Russell Peters,?,NA,1970,Tame,15,41,1498,2156,"Russell Peters is already a comedy superstar in much of the world.  A recent one-off appearance at London’s Shaw Theatre sold out in 48 hours and when his first shows in Sydney and Melbourne were announced in May 2006, 10,000 tickets were gone in less than two days with zero advertising.  In April 2005, Russell was the first South Asian to headline and sell-out the Apollo Theatre in New York City. Common knowledge decrees that a comedian must have a TV sitcom, a hit movie or a high profile comedy album to succeed, but Russell has built a massive underground following by word of mouth, completely bypassing mainstream media outlets.  For the past few years he’s been selling out theatres across the US and Canada, all without ever appearing on network television in the United States.  His US agents, Creative Artists Agency, calls this phenomenon ‘The Legend Of Russell Peters.’Russell has made his reputation by speaking to people that no one else is talking to.  Much of his comedy speaks to immigrant communities around the world - Indian, Arab, Caribbean, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, and other South and Southeast Asian communities that remain invisible to the mainstream media and sometimes to the broader white population.  Russell’s new DVD and CD, Outsourced, was taped before a sold out audience at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco, and gives viewers and listeners an excellent overview of Russell’s comedic genius.  He paces the stage interacting with the audience, tossing off one-liners and engaging in impromptu dialogue with his fans. As much a humorist as a comedian, Russell doesn’t really tell jokes.  Rather, he uses his wry observations on the subjects of race and class to illuminate our human shortcomings with the sizzling accuracy of a well-aimed laser. “I don’t put people down,” Russell points out.  “I want to elevate them, but in a funny way.” His quick wit and ability to mimic language and accents allows Russell to create characters of all races and cultures and forge an immediate bond with his audiences, regardless of their racial and cultural background.  Outsourced has gone Five Times Platinum in his home country of Canada.Russell has been doing stand up for 17 years and already has an impressive resume.  He had a recurring role in the Canadian sitcom Lord Have Mercy and hosted his own BBC chat show Network East Late, where he interviewed Ismail Merchant, of Merchant Ivory productions, UK hit makers Faithless, Gurinder Chadha, director of Bend It Like Beckham and many other South Asian and mainstream artists and personalities.  His movie credits include the comedy Quarter Life Crises, My Baby’s Daddy, martial arts flick Tiger Claws III and the forthcoming bank heist thriller The Take with John Leguizamo and Rosie Perez.Russell has been nominated for four Gemini Awards [the Canadian equivalent of the Emmys].  He has been featured at Montreal’s Just For Laughs Comedy Festival, HBO’s Aspen Comedy Festival, the Edinburgh (Scotland) Comedy Festival and many others across the globe.  His TV appearances include CBC’s  Comics! and two one-hour Comedy Now! specials on The Comedy Network in Canada.  His Comedy Now! performance of February 2004 is one of the network’s most popular shows of all time. When fans placed segments of the special on the internet it created a global demand for Russell comedy and his popularity exploded. His website, www.russellpeters.com, gets over 7,000 hits a day and alerts his many fans to his upcoming shows via targeted email blasts.  He’s performed in China, South Africa, Australia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Jamaica, St. Maartens, Trinidad, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates and in 2007, will be the first North American comic to tour India.Russell’s comedy is rooted in the reality of growing up brown in white Canadian society. “My family and I are Anglo-Indian,” Russell explains. “Anglo-Indians are a community of Indians from India who mixed with the British when they occupied India.  Both of my parents are Anglo-Indian and their parents were Anglo-Indians and so on.”Despite his success in Canada, Russell recently relocated to Hollywood, where he’s working on developing a new sitcom projects.  “Developing a TV pilot is great, but I’m never accepting typecast roles. If they offer me a million dollars to do a shuffling, bumbling Indian guy they can keep the million bucks. I like the money, but I’d do it without the money and I have done it without the money.  The real reward is seeing the look of happiness on people’s faces when they hear me talking to their experiences in a way that nobody’s ever done before.”Rob Light, a partner at Creative Artists Agency, the agency that also handles Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, put it this way: “Russell has a great future in comedy on TV and in movies.  He’s getting attention from Hollywood because he’s already done it all on his own.  He’s a naturally funny person with a multicultural outlook that allows him to be entertaining to people of all races and backgrounds. Nobody’s ever had an outlook like him before.”"

Sarah Silverman,December,1,1970,Dirty,78,61,2589,1659,"Early lifeSilverman was born in Bedford, New Hampshire to Jewish parents of Russian and Polish descent, Donald and Beth Ann Silverman. In a few interviews and in standup routines, she has invented false but comical descriptions of her ethnic/racial heritage, speaking of having “Chinese,” “Italian,” “Armenian,” “Mexican,” or even “black” American, in addition to Jewish, ancestry. She has three sisters: Susan Silverman-Abramowitz, a rabbi and author of Jewish Family & Life: Traditions, Holidays, and Values for Today’s Parents and Children; actress Laura Silverman (who plays one of her friends in the film version of Jesus is Magic and also co-stars as herself in Sarah’s sitcom); and screenwriter Jody Speyer.CareerShe received national exposure after earning a role on the 1993-94 season of Saturday Night Live. She was a writer and featured player at this time, but was fired after one season because she had written only one sketch that survived through to dress rehearsal and none which made it to air. Bob Odenkirk, a former SNL writer who knew her from her stand-up act in Los Angeles, commented on why she was fired: “I could see how it wouldn’t work at SNL because she’s got her own voice, she’s very much Sarah Silverman all the time. She can play a character but she doesn’t disappear into the character—she makes the character her.” Silverman states that she was fired by SNL in an undignified manner (via fax) and this upset her greatly.This situation was parodied when she appeared in The Larry Sanders Show episode The New Writer, in which she appears as the new writer on Larry’s staff and her jokes are not used because of the “chauvinism”, disregard for female comedians and possible bias of the male head comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers.She then moved on to the HBO sketch comedy show Mr. Show with Bob and David, where she was a featured performer. Silverman made guest appearances on such programs as the 1997 Seinfeld episode “The Money,” the two-part time-travel episode “Future’s End” of Star Trek: Voyager and as a series regular on the TV show Greg the Bunny (2002), playing serious characters, as well as the voice of character “Hadassah Guberman” on the salacious puppet television comedy Crank Yankers. She has also had small parts in films such as There’s Something About Mary, Say It Isn’t So, School of Rock, The Way of the Gun, Overnight Delivery, Screwed, Heartbreakers, Evolution and Rent, again playing serious roles. On November 11, 2005, her stand-up comedy act (one-woman show) was released as a feature film, Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic. As part of the publicity campaign surrounding the film, Silverman made several high profile appearances, including online in Slate, as the cover subject of Heeb magazine, and performing on the Comedy Central roasts of Pamela Anderson and Hugh Hefner.On Jimmy Kimmel Live, she has parodied sketches from Chappelle’s Show, as a point of view of what would happen if she played Rick James, Tyrone, or the Pilot Boy Productions-like logo called Pilot Girl Productions. This segment is based on a popular rumor that Silverman is a planned replacement for Dave Chappelle after the apparent demise of his popular television show Chappelle’s Show.Sarah recently made the cover of London’s March 12, 2006 Sunday Observer magazine with an article titled “If women aren’t funny, how come the world’s hottest, most controversial comedian is female?”In 2006, she placed #50 in the annual Maxim magazine Hot 100 List.Silverman in Jesus Is Magic.On November 11, 2005, Silverman’s concert movie, Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic was released in eight theatres. Based on her popular one-woman show of the same name, it was directed by Liam Lynch and distributed by Roadside Attractions. Receiving positive reviews, it made just under $125,000 on its opening weekend, and had the highest per-screen average on only 7 screens. Its performance led to an expanded release in as many as 57 theatres, resulting in a box office take of more than $1.3 million. The movie released on DVD on June 6, 2006, with an official soundtrack released on the same day. The soundtrack featured songs in the movie, some of her standup from the movie, and some previously unreleased songs.Silverman’s own sitcom, The Sarah Silverman Program debuted on Comedy Central on February 1, 2007. It is similar to the popular Curb Your Enthusiasm in that it follows a fictional version of the actress.The show proved to be a ratings success, scoring the highest premiere ratings that a Comedy Central show has had in three years with 1.8 million viewers and the highest 18-49 rating of the night on cable.ControversiesSilverman caused a brief controversy after using the ethnic slur “chink” in an interview on the July 11, 2001 episode of Late Night with Conan O’Brien. In the interview, Silverman explained that a friend had advised her on how to avoid jury duty by writing a racial slur on the selection form, “something really inappropriate, like, ‘I hate chinks’.” However, Silverman said that she ultimately decided that she did not want to be thought of as a racist and instead wrote, “I love chinks. And who doesn’t?” Even though Silverman claimed to be satirizing the racist thought process, Guy Aoki, co-founder and head of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) objected to her use of the slur, saying that NBC’s airing of it was inexcusable. NBC and O’Brien issued an apology, but Silverman did not, later appearing on Politically Incorrect on July 26, and August 22, 2001. During the former episode, Asian actress Kelly Hu stated that she understood the point of the joke, and did not object to it, and Silverman questioned Aoki’s sincerity, accusing him of exploiting the opportunity for publicity. During the latter episode, Aoki appeared with Silverman, and stated that he did not accept Silverman’s explanation, saying that it was not successful satire, that she should have subsituted “chink” with “Chinese person”, and that comedians should consult with groups such as his before performing such material. Silverman stated in an interview on NPR’s Fresh Air that she was asked to repeat the joke on Politically Incorrect, among other places, but she eventually felt compelled to drop the joke from her act because she felt it was becoming stale.Silverman has since turned the complaint into grist for her stand-up act, saying that the experience helped teach her the important lesson that racism is bad: “And I mean bad, like in that black way.” Her stand-up act is similarly charged with outrageously ironic racist statements, delivered in a convincingly serious manner:    “Everybody blames the Jews for killing Christ, and then the Jews try to pass it off on the Romans. I’m one of the few people who believe it was the blacks.”    “I was raped by a doctor, which is so bittersweet for a Jewish girl.”    “Everyone knows that the best time to get pregnant is when you’re a black teenager.”Another classic snapshot of Silverman is what Paul Provenza called a “disconcerting and uncomfortable” performance of the infamous joke called The Aristocrats in his documentary of the same name. In her version of the joke she accuses Joe Franklin of raping her, in a deadpan manner. On the DVD release of the film, Provenza joked that Silverman had planned a publicity stunt in which she filed rape charges against Franklin.Personal lifeSilverman talked about having dated Dave Attell on one of her appearances on the Howard Stern radio show. Silverman was also romantically linked with Colin Quinn during her Saturday Night Live career, which is referred to humorously by both parties. According to NNDB.com, she also dated comedian Sam Seder. In her first appearance on the Stern show in June 2001, she said she was dating someone named Tom who wrote for SNL and Michael Moore.Since 2002, Silverman has been in a relationship with Jimmy Kimmel, host of Jimmy Kimmel Live. It is a relationship she refers to in some of her comic material:    “I wear this Saint Christopher medal sometimes because–I’m Jewish, but my boyfriend is Catholic –it was cute the way he gave it to me. He said if it doesn’t burn through my skin it will protect me.”     “I’m not going to make fun of Jimmy anymore because he might withhold his tiny penis from me.”Silverman is a fan of Jenny Lewis and appeared in one of Lewis’s music videos. She also is a fan of comedian Steve Martin and got a lot of inspiration from him growing up.Silverman is very open about her lifelong battle with clinical depression, crediting her freedom from attacks of emotional despair to her use of prescription Zoloft. Silverman said she’s a teetotaller because she says alcohol nauseates her. She has, however, claimed that she smokes marijuana at least four days out of each week.Silverman says she doesn’t want to get married until same-sex couples are able to."
Sebastian Maniscalco,July,NA,1973,Tame,7,43.2,221,291,"Saying what we’re all thinking has always been Sebastian Maniscalco’s specialty.Except when he says it, it’s a whole lot funnier.And in his brand new Showtime standup special “Aren’t You Embarrassed?” debuting on November 14, the sophisticated comedian with the chiseled cheekbones gives us a hilarious reality check of the world we all find ourselves living in. Continuing to bring his witheringly sarcastic and exasperated take on modern behavior and etiquette in his second Showtime special in two years, Sebastian takes on everything from selfies that he calls “lonelies” (“Do you know how alone you have to be to have 838 photos of yourself in your bathroom?”) to online restaurant reviews (“Who’s got the time to write an 18 page essay on asparagus?”) to airport check-ins (“I’m taking out a boot,a sock,a toothpaste,does anyone know what two pounds is?”). The special has already spawned the Twitter hash tag #Aren’tYouEmbarrassed, with thousands of followers donating their take via social media on the absurdities of everyday life in the year 2014.Taping the special “Aren’t You Embarrassed?” in Chicago was a homecoming of sorts for the self-proclaimed ‘half-Sicilian, half-Italian’ who grew up in the middle class suburbs of Chicago (“The world doesn’t match my upbringing”). Priding himself on a work ethic his father instilled in him when he began working at the age of 8, Sebastian made his first dime as an altar boy at funerals during his lunch break to contribute to the family.Still sporting his Chicago accent despite leaving the Windy City in the early 2000’s to follow his dream in Los Angeles, Sebastian began paying his comedy dues by night playing his brand of comedy in bars and bowling alleys while working as a waiter at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. He eventually broke into the national spotlight with a 20-city tour in support of his one-hour Comedy Central DVD Special. Yet, it wasn’t until Sebastian captured the attention of award-winning actor and entertainer Vince Vaughn who selected him to be one of four featured comedians in the critically acclaimed film “Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show” that his comedy career began to explode."
